        content: "The spread of maize cultivation from present day Mexico northward into the present-day American Southwest and beyond supported economic development, settlement, advanced irrigation, and social diversification among societies.  Societies responded to the aridity of the Great Basin and the grasslands of the western Great Plains by developing largely mobile lifestyles. In the Northeast, the Mississippi River Valley, and along the Atlantic seaboard, some societies developed mixed agricultural and hunter-gatherer economies that favored the development of permanent villages. Societies in the Northwestern present-day California supported themselves by hunting and gathering, and in some areas developed settled communities supported by the vast resources of the ocean. - European nations’ efforts to explore and conquer the New World stemmed from a search for new sources of wealth, economic and military competition, and a desire to spread Christianity. The Columbian Exchange brought new crops to Europe from the Americas, stimulating European population growth, and new sources of mineral wealth, which facilitated the European shift from feudalism to capitalism. Improvements in maritime technology and more organized methods for conducting international trade,such as joint-stock companies, helped drive changes to economies in Europe and the Americas. Spanish exploration and conquest of the Americas were accompanied and furthered by widespread deadly epidemics that devastated native populations and by the introduction of crops and animals not found in the Americas. - In the encomienda system, Spanish colonial economies marshaled Native American labor tosupportplantation-basedagricultureand extract precious metals and other resources. European traders partnered with some West African groups who practiced slavery to forcibly extract enslaved laborers for the Americas. The Spanish imported enslaved Africans to labor in plantation agriculture and mining. The Spanish developed a caste system that incorporated,and carefully defined the status of the diverse population of Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans in their empire.- In their interactions, Europeans and Native Americans asserted divergent worldviews regarding issues such as religion, gender roles, family, land use, and power. Mutual misunderstandings between Europeans andNativeAmericansoftendefinedtheearly years of interaction and trade as each group sought to make sense of the other. Over time, Europeans and Native Americans adopted some useful aspects of each other’s culture. As European encroachments on Native Americans’ lands and demands on their labor increased, native peoples sought to defend and maintain their political sovereignty, economic prosperity, religious beliefs, and concepts of gender relations through diplomatic negotiations and military resistance."

        topic: "How different European colonies developed and expanded, Transatlantic trade, Interactions between American Indians and Europeans, Slavery in the British colonies, Colonial society and culture",
        content: "- Spanish efforts to extract wealth from the land led them to develop institutions based on subjugating native populations, converting them to Christianity, and incorporating them, along with enslaved and free Africans, into Spanish colonial society. - French and Dutch colonial efforts involved relatively few Europeans and relied on trade alliances and intermarriage with American Indians to build economic and diplomatic relationships and acquire furs and other products for export to Europe. English Colonization Efforts Attracted a comparatively large number of male and female British migrants, as well as other European migrants, all of whom sought social mobility, economic prosperity, religious freedom, and improved living conditions. These colonists focused on agriculture and settled on land taken from Native Americans from whom they lived separately. - The Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies grew prosperous exporting tobacco—a labor intensive product initially cultivated by white, mostly male indentured servants and later by enslaved Africans. The New England colonies, initially settled by Puritans, developed around small towns with family farms and achieved a thriving mixed economy of agriculture and commerce. The middle colonies supported a flourishing export economy based on cereal crops and attracted a broad range of European migrants, leading to societies with greater cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity and tolerance. The colonies of the southern Atlantic coast and the British West Indies used long growing seasons to develop plantation economies based on exporting staple crops. They depended on the labor of enslaved Africans, who often constituted the majority of the population in these areas and developed their own forms of cultural and religious autonomy. - An Atlantic economy developed in which goods, as well as enslaved Africans and American Indians, were exchanged between Europe, Africa, and the Americas through extensive trade networks. European colonial economies focused on acquiring, producing, and exporting commodities that were valued in Europe and gaining new sources of labor. Continuing trade with Europeans increased the flow of goods in and out of American Indian communities, stimulating cultural and economic changes and spreading epidemic diseases that caused radical demographic shifts. The British government increasingly attempted to incorporate its North American colonies into a coherent, hierarchical, and imperial structure in order to pursue mercantilist economic aims, but conflicts with colonists and American Indians led to erratic enforcement of imperial policies. - Interactions between European rivals and American Indian populations fostered both accommodation and conflict. French,Dutch, British, and Spanish colonies allied with and armed American Indian groups, who frequently sought alliances with Europeans against other American Indian groups. British conflicts with American Indians over land, resources, and political boundaries led to military confrontations, such as Metacom’s War (King Philip’s War) in New England. American Indian resistance to Spanish colonizing efforts in North America, particularly after the Pueblo Revolt, led to Spanish accommodation of some aspects of American Indian culture in the Southwest. - All the British colonies participated to varying degrees in the Atlantic slave trade due to the abundance of land and a growing European demand for colonial goods, as well as a shortage of indentured servants. Small New England farms used relatively few enslaved laborers, all port cities held significant minorities of enslaved people, and the emerging plantation systems of the Chesapeake and the southern Atlantic coast had large numbers of enslaved workers, while the great majority of enslaved Africans were sent to the West Indies. As chattel slavery became the dominant labor system in many southern colonies, new laws created a strict racial system that prohibited interracial relationships and defined the descendants of African American mothers as black and enslaved in perpetuity. - The presence of different European religious and ethnic groups contributed to a significant degree of pluralism and intellectual exchange, which were later enhanced by the first Great Awakening and the spread of European Enlightenment ideas. The British colonies experienced a gradual Anglicization Over time, developing autonomous political communities based on English models with influence from intercolonial commercial ties, the emergence of a transatlantic print culture, and the spread of Protestant evangelicalism.”

        topic: "The Seven Years’ War, The American Revolution, The Articles of Confederation, The creation and ratification of the Constitution, Developing an American identity, Immigration to and migration within America",
        content: "- French and Indian war, Colonial rivalry intensified between Britain and France in the mid-18th century, as the growing population of the British colonies expanded into the interior of North America, threatening French–Indian trade networks and American Indian autonomy. Britain achieved a major expansion of its territorial holdings by defeating the French, but at tremendous expense, setting the stage for imperial efforts to raise revenue and consolidate control over the colonies. After British victory,imperial officials' attempts to prevent colonists from moving westward generated colonial opposition, while native groups sought to both continue trading with Europeans and resist the encroachments of colonists on tribal lands. - The imperial struggles of the mid-18th century, as well as new British efforts to collect taxes without direct colonial representation or consent and to assert imperial authority in the colonies, began to unite the colonists against perceived and real constraints on their economic activities and political rights. Colonial leaders based their calls for resistance to Britain on arguments about the rights of British subjects, the rights of the individual, local traditions of self-rule,and the ideas of the Enlightenment. The effort for American independence was energized by colonial leaders such as Benjamin Franklin, as well as by popular movements that included the political activism of laborers, artisans, and women. In the face of economic shortages and the British military occupation of some regions, men and women mobilized in large numbers to provide financial and material support for the Patriot movement. - Enlightenment ideas and philosophy inspired many American political thinkers to emphasize individual talent over hereditary privilege, while religion strengthened Americans’ view of themselves as a people blessed with liberty. The colonists’ belief in the superiority of republican forms of government based on the natural rights of the people found expression in Thomas Paine’s Common Sense and the Declaration of Independence. The ideas in these documents resonated throughout American history, shaping Americans’ understanding of the ideals on which the nation was based. - Despite considerable loyalist opposition, as well as Great Britain’s apparently overwhelming military and financial advantages, the Patriot cause succeeded because of the actions of colonial militias and the Continental Army, George Washington’s military leadership, the colonists’ ideological commitment and resilience, and assistance sent by European allies. - During and after the American Revolution, an increased awareness of inequalities in society motivated some individuals and groups to call for the abolition of slavery and greater political democracy in the new state and national governments. In response to women’s participation in the American Revolution, Enlightenment ideas, and women’s appeals for expanded roles, an ideal of “republican motherhood” gained popularity. It called on women to teach republican values within the family and granted women a new importance in American political culture. - Many new state constitutions placed power in the hands of the legislative branch and changed as a result of maintained property qualifications for voting and citizenship. The Articles of Confederation united the newly independent states, creating a central government with limited power. After the Revolution,difficulties over international trade, finances, interstate commerce,foreign relations, and internal unrest led to calls for a stronger central government. As settlers moved westward during the 1780s, Congress enacted the Northwest Ordinance for admitting new states; the ordinance promoted public education, the protection of private property, and a ban on slavery in the Northwest Territory. - Delegates from the states participated in the Constitutional Convention and through negotiation, collaboration, and compromise proposed a constitution. The Constitutional Convention compromised over the representation of slave states in Congress and the role of the federal government in regulating both slavery and the slave trade, allowing the prohibition of the international slave trade after 1808. In the debate over ratifying the Constitution, Anti-Federalists opposing ratification battled with Federalists, whose principles were articulated in the Federalist Papers (primarily written by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison). Federalists ensured the ratification of the Constitution by promising the addition of a Bill of Rights that enumerated individual rights and explicitly restricted the powers of the federal government. - Delegates from the states participated in the Constitutional Convention that created a limited but dynamic central government embodying federalism and providing for a separation of powers between its three branches. - The U.S. government forged diplomatic initiatives aimed at dealing with the continued British and Spanish presence in North America, as U.S. settlers migrated beyond the Appalachians and sought free navigation of the Mississippi River. War between France and Britain resulting from the French Revolution presented challenges to the United States over issues of free trade and foreign policy and fostered political disagreement. The Spanish, supported by the bonded labor of the local American Indians, expanded their mission settlements into California; these provided opportunities for social mobility among soldiers and led to new cultural blending. An ambiguous relationship between the federal government and American Indian tribes contributed to problems regarding treaties and American Indian legal claims relating to the seizure of their lands. - During the presidential administrations of George Washington and John Adams, political systems developed and leaders created institutions and precedents that put the principles of the Constitution into practice. Political leaders in the 1790s took a variety of positions on issues such as the relationship between the national government and the states, economic policy, foreign policy, and the balance between liberty and order. This led to the formation of political parties— most significantly the Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton,and the Democratic- Republican Party,led by Thomas Jeferson and James Madison. George Washington’s Farewell Address encouraged national unity, as he cautioned against political factions and warned about the danger of permanent foreign alliances. - Various American Indian groups repeatedly evaluated and adjusted their alliances with Europeans, other tribes, and the United States, and seeking to limit migration of white settlers and maintain control of tribal lands and natural resources. British alliances with American Indians contributed to tensions between the United States and Britain As increasing numbers of migrants from North America and other parts of the world continued to move westward, frontier cultures that had emerged in the colonial period continued to grow, fueling social, political, and ethnic tensions. The expansion of slavery in the deep South and adjacent western lands and rising anti slavery sentiment began to create distinctive regional attitudes towards slavery.”

        topic: "The rise of political parties American foreign policy, Innovations in technology, agriculture, and business, Debates about federal power, The Second Great Awakening, Reform movements, The experience of African Americans",
        content: "The period from 1800 to 1848 was marked by the solidification of American democracy, the expansion of federal authority, major regional transformations, and the emergence of reform movements that reshaped American society. The election of 1800, often referred to as the “Revolution of 1800,” set the tone. Thomas Jefferson’s victory over John Adams symbolized a peaceful transition of power from the Federalist to the Democratic-Republican Party, a major test for the young republic. Jefferson’s presidency emphasized a more agrarian vision of America, reduced the size of the military, and attempted to limit the power of the federal government. However, in practice, Jefferson expanded federal power through actions like the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, which doubled the size of the U.S. and challenged Jefferson’s own strict constructionist philosophy. The judiciary also asserted its power during this time. The landmark Supreme Court case Marbury v. Madison (1803), under Chief Justice John Marshall, established the principle of judicial review, allowing the Court to declare laws unconstitutional, significantly increasing the power of the judiciary. Marshall’s decisions in cases like McCulloch v. Maryland and Gibbons v. Ogden further strengthened federal authority over the states and promoted a more nationally integrated economy. The War of 1812, often dubbed the “Second War for Independence,” emerged from tensions with Britain over maritime rights and frontier conflicts. Though militarily inconclusive, the war had profound effects. It ended the Federalist Party after the Hartford Convention, elevated national pride, and weakened Native American resistance in the Northwest. The postwar period, called the “Era of Good Feelings” under President James Monroe, saw a brief period of political unity and economic growth, but deep divisions were simmering beneath the surface. The Market Revolution transformed the American economy and society. Innovations like the cotton gin (1793), the telegraph (1844), and the steam engine powered industrial growth and transportation. The construction of canals, particularly the Erie Canal, and railroads connected the Northeast and Midwest, facilitating the movement of goods, people, and ideas. The rise of factories, especially in New England, shifted the economy from home-based production to wage labor. The Lowell System exemplified this change by employing young women in textile mills under regimented schedules. As the economy diversified, so did regional identities. The North became increasingly industrial and urban, while the South remained agrarian and reliant on slave labor. The invention of the cotton gin intensified the demand for enslaved labor in the South, strengthening the institution of slavery and deepening sectional tensions. Meanwhile, westward expansion led to the forced removal of Native Americans through policies like the Indian Removal Act of 1830, culminating in the Trail of Tears under President Andrew Jackson. Jacksonian Democracy, the dominant political ideology of the 1820s and 1830s, emphasized the common man, universal white male suffrage, and opposition to aristocratic privilege. Jackson’s presidency expanded executive power and was marked by controversial decisions, such as the veto of the Second Bank of the United States and the implementation of the spoils system. His conflict with South Carolina during the Nullification Crisis highlighted the growing sectional conflict and debates over federal authority. Reform movements flourished in response to the societal disruptions of the Market Revolution and the democratizing spirit of the age. Inspired by the Second Great Awakening, which emphasized individual salvation and social improvement, Americans launched efforts to reform prisons, establish public education (led by Horace Mann), promote temperance, and improve conditions for the mentally ill (spearheaded by Dorothea Dix). The abolitionist movement gained momentum, with figures like William Lloyd Garrison advocating immediate emancipation and Frederick Douglass using his experience as a former slave to challenge the institution. Women also began to assert themselves in the public sphere, particularly through reform work. The Seneca Falls Convention in 1848 marked a watershed moment, as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott issued the Declaration of Sentiments, demanding equal rights, including suffrage, for women. Although suffrage would not be realized for decades, the convention laid the groundwork for the women’s rights movement. In foreign affairs, the Monroe Doctrine (1823) signaled a growing sense of national identity and hemispheric dominance, warning European powers to avoid further colonization in the Americas. This period also saw the beginnings of American expansionism and Manifest Destiny, as Americans believed it was their divine right to spread civilization and democracy across the continent. By 1848, the United States had grown dramatically in size, power, and complexity. The contradictions between liberty and slavery, democracy and exclusion, unity and sectionalism were increasingly apparent, setting the stage for more intense conflict in the years to come.”

        title: "Civil War and Reconstruction",
        period: "Period 5, 1844-1877",
        topic: "Manifest Destiny, The Mexican–American War, Attempts to resolve conflicts over the spread of slavery, The election of 1860 and Southern secession, The Civil War, Reconstruction",
        content: "Unit 5 of APUSH traces the intensifying divisions between North and South over slavery, the eruption of the Civil War, and the turbulent Reconstruction that followed. The period begins with the concept of Manifest Destiny—a powerful ideology that asserted the United States had a divine right to expand westward across the continent. This belief was central to President James K. Polk’s administration, which aggressively pursued territorial acquisition. Under Polk, the U.S. annexed Texas (1845), provoking tensions with Mexico. The Mexican-American War (1846–1848) followed, ending in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, through which the U.S. gained vast territory including California, Arizona, and New Mexico. The new land intensified debates over whether slavery should expand into the territories. This debate reached a boiling point with the Wilmot Proviso, a proposal to ban slavery in all territory gained from Mexico. Though it failed, it revealed the deep sectional rift. Compromise efforts followed, most notably the Compromise of 1850, which admitted California as a free state, allowed popular sovereignty in the Utah and New Mexico territories, ended the slave trade in Washington D.C., and strengthened the Fugitive Slave Act. The latter provision enraged Northerners, many of whom were drawn into the abolitionist cause upon witnessing the brutality of slave catchers operating in free states. The sectional crisis deepened with the publication of Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1852) by Harriet Beecher Stowe, which humanized the plight of slaves and mobilized Northern opinion against the South. The Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), proposed by Stephen Douglas, repealed the Missouri Compromise by allowing popular sovereignty in territories north of the 36°30′ line. This led to violent conflict in “Bleeding Kansas” as pro- and anti-slavery forces clashed, foreshadowing the national conflict to come. The act also gave rise to the Republican Party, which united former Whigs, Free Soilers, and anti-slavery Democrats around opposition to the expansion of slavery. The 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford decision by the Supreme Court inflamed tensions further. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney ruled that African Americans were not citizens and that Congress could not prohibit slavery in the territories, effectively nullifying the Missouri Compromise. This decision delighted Southerners and enraged Northerners, especially Republicans. Abraham Lincoln, during the Lincoln-Douglas debates (1858), gained national prominence by arguing against the spread of slavery while acknowledging its constitutional protection in the South. John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 attempted to incite a slave rebellion and confirmed Southern fears of Northern aggression. Though unsuccessful, Brown became a martyr in the North and a terrorist in the South. The election of 1860 sealed the fracture. Abraham Lincoln’s victory, despite receiving no Southern electoral votes, led Southern states to secede, beginning with South Carolina. By early 1861, seven states had formed the Confederate States of America under Jefferson Davis. The Civil War began in April 1861 with the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter. Lincoln framed the war initially as a struggle to preserve the Union, but as the conflict progressed, emancipation became a central aim. The war was defined by major battles—Antietam (1862), Gettysburg (1863), Vicksburg (1863)—and by technological and strategic innovations like the use of railroads, the telegraph, and total war tactics. The Union’s industrial and population advantages became critical as the war dragged on. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued in 1863 following the Battle of Antietam, freed slaves in the Confederate states and reframed the war as a moral struggle against slavery. It also allowed African Americans to serve in the Union Army. Meanwhile, Lincoln faced political opposition from Copperheads (Northern Democrats who wanted peace) and managed growing dissent using measures like the suspension of habeas corpus. Victory for the Union came in 1865, after General Sherman’s March to the Sea devastated the South’s infrastructure and economy. General Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court House ended major fighting. The assassination of Lincoln just days later left Reconstruction in the hands of his successor, Andrew Johnson, a Southern Democrat who clashed bitterly with Radical Republicans in Congress. Reconstruction (1865–1877) was a contested and complex period. Radical Republicans sought to remake Southern society by extending civil and political rights to freedmen. The 13th Amendment abolished slavery; the 14th granted citizenship and equal protection; and the 15th prohibited voter discrimination based on race. The Freedmen’s Bureau attempted to aid newly freed African Americans with education, housing, and legal support, but was underfunded and met with fierce resistance. Southern resistance took many forms, from Black Codes designed to restrict African Americans’ freedom to violent white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan. Congressional Reconstruction placed Southern states under military control to enforce the new laws and protect Black citizens. However, Johnson’s lenient policies and his vetoes of civil rights legislation alienated Congress, leading to his impeachment in 1868, though he was narrowly acquitted. The 1870s saw growing Northern fatigue with Reconstruction, economic depression after the Panic of 1873, and the resurgence of Democratic control in the South. “Redeemer” governments rolled back Republican reforms, often through intimidation and voter suppression. The Compromise of 1877, which resolved the contested 1876 presidential election in favor of Republican Rutherford B. Hayes, effectively ended Reconstruction. In exchange, Hayes withdrew federal troops from the South, allowing white Democrats to reassert control. This led to the rise of Jim Crow laws and a century of disenfranchisement and racial segregation. By 1877, the promises of Reconstruction had been largely abandoned. While slavery was abolished and citizenship guaranteed on paper, the reality for African Americans in the South remained one of economic dependence, political exclusion, and systemic racism.”

        topic: "The settlement of the West, The 'New South', The rise of industrial capitalism, Immigration and migration, Reform movements, Debates about the role of government"
        content: "Following the Civil War, the United States experienced rapid economic growth, industrial expansion, and urbanization during the Gilded Age—a term coined by Mark Twain to describe the era's glittering surface and underlying corruption. The period saw the rise of big business, increased immigration, labor unrest, and intense political debate over economic and social issues. Industrialization transformed the American economy. Massive railroad expansion, including the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, linked markets, enabled resource extraction, and facilitated westward expansion. Captains of industry—often called "robber barons" by critics—like Andrew Carnegie (steel), John D. Rockefeller (oil), and J.P. Morgan (finance) amassed enormous wealth through vertical and horizontal integration, trusts, and monopolies. Carnegie's "Gospel of Wealth" articulated the belief that the wealthy had a duty to use their fortunes for public good, while Social Darwinism justified inequality as the natural outcome of competition. The federal government largely adhered to laissez-faire policies during this time, though it granted subsidies to railroads and implemented tariffs to protect American industry. Corruption flourished, as seen in scandals like the Credit Mobilier affair and the Whiskey Ring. Political machines, particularly Tammany Hall in New York, wielded significant influence over urban politics by trading services for votes among immigrant communities. Urbanization intensified as millions of immigrants, particularly from Southern and Eastern Europe, arrived in the U.S. from the 1880s onward. They settled in crowded tenement housing in growing cities, where they labored in factories under harsh conditions. Nativist backlash led to restrictions like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first major federal immigration law. Laborers, facing low wages, long hours, and unsafe working conditions, began to organize. The Knights of Labor, led by Terence Powderly, sought broad social reforms, while the American Federation of Labor (AFL), under Samuel Gompers, focused on skilled workers and practical improvements like wages and hours. Major strikes, including the Great Railroad Strike (1877), Haymarket Riot (1886), and Pullman Strike (1894), often ended in violence and drew public criticism of labor unions.The South remained largely agricultural and impoverished, with sharecropping and tenant farming keeping many Black and poor white farmers in cycles of debt and dependence. Jim Crow laws institutionalized segregation and disenfranchisement through poll taxes, literacy tests, and violence, particularly lynching. The 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision upheld “separate but equal,” legitimizing racial segregation.Westward expansion continued with the displacement of Native Americans. The Indian Wars culminated in tragedies like the Battle of Little Bighorn (1876) and the Wounded Knee Massacre (1890). Federal policy shifted toward assimilation, exemplified by the Dawes Act (1887), which broke up tribal landholdings and aimed to force Native Americans into individual farming, undermining tribal culture.Farmers also struggled under debt, declining crop prices, and railroad monopolies. The Granger movement and later the Populist Party emerged to represent agrarian interests. Populists, led by figures like William Jennings Bryan, called for the free coinage of silver, regulation of railroads, a graduated income tax, and greater political participation through initiatives and referenda. Though the movement peaked in the 1890s, it influenced later Progressive reforms."

        content: "Unit 7 marks a dramatic transformation in American politics, society, and international relations. The Progressive Era emerged in response to the excesses of the Gilded Age. Reformers from both political parties sought to curb the power of corporations, improve living conditions, and make government more responsive. Muckrakers like Upton Sinclair (The Jungle) and Ida Tarbell exposed corporate abuse and social injustices, prompting reforms. Key Progressive legislation included the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act, both passed under Theodore Roosevelt. The Progressive presidents—Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson—expanded federal regulatory power. Roosevelt’s Square Deal targeted monopolies (trust-busting), consumer protection, and conservation. Taft pursued antitrust cases and established the Children’s Bureau, while Wilson’s New Freedom saw the creation of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Trade Commission. The 16th through 19th Amendments established an income tax, direct senatorial elections, prohibition, and women’s suffrage, respectively. America's role in world affairs grew. The Spanish-American War (1898) resulted in U.S. acquisition of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico, signaling a new imperialist phase. The U.S. justified its actions through ideas like the White Man’s Burden and Anglo-Saxon superiority. Anti-imperialist voices, including Mark Twain and the Anti-Imperialist League, objected on moral and constitutional grounds. Roosevelt’s “Big Stick” diplomacy and the construction of the Panama Canal demonstrated assertive foreign policy, while Wilson’s later moral diplomacy aimed to spread democracy. World War I marked America’s emergence as a global power. Initially neutral, the U.S. entered the war in 1917 due to unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann Telegram. The war effort mobilized the economy and society. The Selective Service Act, War Industries Board, and propaganda campaigns managed manpower and morale. The Espionage and Sedition Acts curtailed dissent, most notably in the case of Schenck v. United States, which upheld limits on free speech during wartime. Wilson’s Fourteen Points outlined a vision for postwar peace, emphasizing self-determination, free trade, and the League of Nations. However, the U.S. Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles, reflecting isolationist sentiment. The 1920s, often seen as a conservative backlash, brought a return to laissez-faire policies under presidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover. The decade featured cultural conflict: urban vs. rural, modernism vs. traditionalism. The Scopes Trial (1925) highlighted tensions over evolution and religion. Meanwhile, the Harlem Renaissance celebrated Black culture, and women experienced new freedoms through flapper culture and increased employment. The 1929 stock market crash triggered the Great Depression. Hoover’s limited response was seen as inadequate. Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal represented a fundamental shift in the role of government. Programs like the CCC, WPA, and Social Security aimed to provide relief, recovery, and reform. Critics came from both left (Huey Long’s Share Our Wealth) and right (business conservatives fearing socialism). The Supreme Court initially struck down key programs but later upheld reforms after FDR’s controversial court-packing plan. World War II ended the Depression. After aiding the Allies through Lend-Lease and embargoes, the U.S. entered the war following Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor. The war effort mobilized the entire economy: women joined the workforce (“Rosie the Riveter”), African Americans pushed for the Double V campaign, and Japanese Americans were interned under Executive Order 9066. Major battles included D-Day (1944) and the Pacific island-hopping campaign. The war ended with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, launching the U.S. into a new role as global superpower and beginning the Cold War era.”

        content: "Following WWII, the United States emerged as a global superpower locked in ideological and geopolitical conflict with the Soviet Union. The Cold War shaped every aspect of foreign and domestic policy. Containment, articulated by George Kennan, guided efforts to prevent the spread of communism. The Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan committed the U.S. to supporting anti-communist regimes and rebuilding war-torn Europe.In 1949, the Soviet Union’s first nuclear test and China’s Communist Revolution shocked Americans. The Korean War (1950–1953) tested the U.S. commitment to containment; though it ended in stalemate, it set a precedent for American involvement in global conflicts. NATO and later SEATO were formed as military alliances to deter Soviet aggression. Domestically, fear of communism spurred the Red Scare, culminating in HUAC hearings and McCarthyism, where Senator Joseph McCarthy exploited fears to accuse political opponents of subversion. The 1950s saw economic prosperity, suburban growth (fueled by the GI Bill), and consumerism. The Baby Boom, mass-produced housing (Levittowns), and car culture defined postwar life. Yet underneath the surface, social change brewed. The civil rights movement gained momentum with Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which overturned Plessy v. Ferguson. The Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955–56), led by Martin Luther King Jr., launched a wave of nonviolent protest. Eisenhower reluctantly enforced desegregation in Little Rock (1957). The 1960s brought greater confrontation. Under JFK, the U.S. faced crises like the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. JFK's assassination in 1963 elevated Lyndon Johnson, who launched the Great Society—a sweeping program to eliminate poverty and racial injustice. Medicare, Medicaid, the Voting Rights Act (1965), and War on Poverty programs sought to fulfill that vision. However, the Vietnam War—justified by the Domino Theory and escalated through the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution—divided the country. The Tet Offensive (1968) shattered public confidence in the war’s progress. Domestically, the civil rights movement expanded. The Civil Rights Act (1964) banned segregation, and the Voting Rights Act (1965) protected Black suffrage. New movements emerged: the Black Power movement, led by figures like Malcolm X; the feminist movement, reinvigorated by Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique; and student protests, especially through Students for a Democratic Society. The 1968 assassinations of MLK and Robert Kennedy marked a year of unrest, followed by conservative backlash.Nixon’s presidency began with détente—an easing of Cold War tensions—achieved through visits to China and the USSR. Domestically, he appealed to the "silent majority" and implemented New Federalism. Yet his administration ended in scandal with Watergate, leading to his resignation in 1974. The decade closed with economic stagnation (“stagflation”), energy crises, and the Iran hostage crisis under Jimmy Carter, which contributed to a national sense of malaise.”

        content: "Unit 9 marks the rise of modern conservatism and the reshaping of American domestic and foreign policy. Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980 symbolized a rightward shift in American politics. Reaganomics promoted tax cuts, deregulation, and supply-side economics, claiming that reducing government intervention would spur economic growth. Critics argued it widened inequality. Reagan also escalated Cold War tensions before later negotiating with Mikhail Gorbachev, contributing to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.The 1990s, under George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, saw the emergence of U.S. unipolar power. The Gulf War demonstrated U.S. military supremacy. At home, Clinton embraced centrist “Third Way” policies: welfare reform, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and a budget surplus. He also faced scandal and impeachment, though he was acquitted. Technological innovation exploded, particularly with the rise of the Internet and personal computing. Economic globalization expanded, bringing both prosperity and anxieties about outsourcing and inequality. Immigration from Latin America and Asia surged, transforming American demographics. Cultural debates over race, gender, and identity intensified. The 2000 election between George W. Bush and Al Gore was contested and decided by the Supreme Court. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, fundamentally altered U.S. policy. The War on Terror included the invasion of Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003), based on disputed claims about weapons of mass destruction. The wars sparked intense debate over civil liberties, torture, surveillance, and foreign policy. Domestically, the 2008 financial crisis triggered a major recession, leading to the election of Barack Obama, the first Black president. His administration passed the Affordable Care Act and managed the economic recovery. His presidency also saw the legalization of same-sex marriage (Obergefell v. Hodges) and the rise of movements like Black Lives Matter. The 2016 election of Donald Trump highlighted deep political polarization. His administration focused on immigration restriction, tax reform, deregulation, and an “America First” foreign policy. His handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and response to the 2020 election loss sparked controversy and culminated in the January 6 Capitol riot. The election of Joe Biden in 2020 emphasized a return to democratic norms amid ongoing debates over race, economics, climate change, and America’s role in the world.”
