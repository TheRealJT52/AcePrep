    title: "Chemistry of Life",
    period: "Unit 1",
    topic: "Structure of Water and Hydrogen Bonding, Elements of Life, Introduction to Biological Macromolecules, Properties of Biological Macromolecules",
    content: "Living systems depend on the properties of water to sustain life. Water has polarity,because of the formation of polar covalent bonds between hydrogen and oxygen within water molecules. This polarity contributes to hydrogen bonding between and within biological molecules. Water has a high specific heat capacity, which allows for the maintenance of homeostatic body temperature within living organisms. Water has a high heat of vaporization, which allows for the evaporative cooling of the surrounding environment. In living organisms, this property allows for body temperature to be maintained. The hydrogen bonds between adjacent polar water molecules result in cohesion, adhesion, and surface tension. Atoms and molecules from the environment are necessary to build new molecules. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are the most prevalent elements used to build biological molecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Additionally: sulfur is used in the building of proteins; phosphorus is used in the building of phospholipids (a type of lipid) and nucleic acids; Nitrogen is used in the building of nucleic acids.  Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction involving the cleaving of covalent bonds. This type of reaction breaks down molecules into smaller molecules. When water is added to the bond between monomers in a polymer, the bond is broken. The hydrogen ion from a water molecule is added to one monomer and the hydroxyl group of the water molecule is added to the other monomer, completing the reaction. Dehydration synthesis occurs when two smaller molecules are joined together through covalent bonding. A hydrogen ion is removed from one monomer and a hydroxyl group is removed from the other. This causes the loss of the equivalent of a water molecule from the reactants and the connection of the two remaining monomers. The connection of many monomers is known as polymerization. Monosaccharides (simple sugars) are the monomers for polysaccharides (complex carbohydrates). These monomers are connected by covalent bonds to form polymers such as complex carbohydrates, which may be linear or branched. EXCLUSION STATEMENT—The molecular structure of specific carbohydrate polymers is beyond the scope of the AP Exam. Lipids are typically nonpolar, hydrophobic molecules whose structure and function are derived from the way their subcomponents are assembled. Fatty acids can be described as either saturated or unsaturated. i. Saturated fatty acids contain only single bonds between carbon atoms. ii. Unsaturated fatty acids contain at least one double bond between carbon atoms, which causes the carbon chain to kink. iii. The more double bonds in a fatty acid tail, the more unsaturated the lipid becomes. iv. The more unsaturated a lipid is, the more liquid it is at room temperature. Lipids provide a variety of functions for living organisms. Some examples of lipids are fats, steroids including cholesterol, and phospholipids. i. Fats provide energy storage and support cell function. In some cases, they can also provide insulation to help keep mammals warm. ii. Steroids are hormones that support physiological functions including growth and development, energy metabolism, and homeostasis. Cholesterol provides essential structural stability to animal cell membranes. Phospholipids group together to form the lipid bilayers found in plasma and cell membranes. In nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), biological information is encoded in sequences of nucleotide monomers. Each nucleotide has the following structural components: a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose or ribose), a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine, or uracil). Nucleic acids have a linear sequence of nucleotides that have ends, defined by the 3’(threeprime) hydroxyl and 5’ (five prime) phosphates of the sugar in the nucleotide. During nucleic acid synthesis, nucleotides are added to the 3’ end of the growing strand, resulting in the formation of covalent bonds between nucleotides. X EXCLUSION STATEMENT—The molecular structure of specific nucleotides is beyond the scope of the AP Exam. is structured as an antiparallel double helix, with two strands of nucleotides running in opposite 5’ to 3’ orientation. In DNA, adenine nucleotides pair with thymine nucleotides viahydrogenbonds(A-T),andcytosine nucleotides pair with guanine nucleotides via hydrogen bonds(C-G). In RNA with uraciladenine pairs with uracil(A-U). Structural differences between DNA and RNA include: i. DNA contains the sugar deoxyribose, and RNA contains the sugar ribose. ii. DNA contains the nitrogenous base thymine, and RNA contains the nitrogenous base uracil. iii. DNA is typically double stranded, while RNA is typically single stranded. Proteins comprise linear chains of amino acids connected by the formation of covalent (peptide) bonds that form between a carboxyl group (−COOH) of one amino acid and an amine group (− NH 2 ) of the next amino acid, resulting in a growing peptide chain. Amino acids are composed of a central carbon atom with a hydrogen atom, a carboxyl group, an amine group, and a variable R group covalently bound to it. The R group of an amino acid can be categorized by three possible chemical properties: hydrophobic/nonpolar, hydrophilic/polar, or ionic. The interactions of these R groups determine the structure and function of that region of the protein. The specific sequence of amino acids in proteins determines the primary structure of a polypeptide as well as the overall shape of the protein. X EXCLUSION STATEMENT—The molecular structure of amino acids is beyond the scope of the AP Exam.  Secondary structures of proteins are made through the local folding that forms from interactions between atoms of the polypeptide backbone of the amino acid chain. Hydrogen bonding forms shapes such as alpha-helices and beta-pleated sheets. The three-dimensional shape of the tertiary structure of a protein results from the formation of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions,ionic interactions,or disulfide bridges. The quaternary structure arises from interactions between multiple polypeptides. All four levels of a protein structure determine the function of a protein."

  title: "Cells",
  period: "Unit 2",
  topic: "Ribosomes, Endomembrane system, Endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi complex, Mitochondria, Chloroplasts, surface area-to-volume ratio, Fluid mosaic model, Selective permeability, Osmoregulation",
  content: "Ribosomes are comprised of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and protein. These non-membrane, subcellular structures are found in cells in all forms of life and reflect the common ancestry in all known life. Ribosomes synthesize proteins according to messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences. The endomembrane system consists of agroupofmembrane-boundorganelles and subcellular components (endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi complex, lysosomes, vacuoles and transport vesicles, the nuclear envelope, and the plasma membrane) that work together to modify, package, and transport polysaccharides, lipids, and proteins intercellularly. Endoplasmic reticulum provides mechanical support by helping cells maintain shape and plays a role in intracellular transport. Rough ER is associated with membrane bound ribosomes, allows for the compartmentalization of cells, and helps carry out protein synthesis. Smooth ER functions include the detoxification of cells and lipid synthesis. The Golgi complex is a membrane-bound structure that consists of a series of flattened membrane sacs. Functions of the Golgi include: Correctly folding and chemically modifying newly synthesized cellular products; Packaging proteins for trafficking Mitochondria have a double membrane that provides compartments for different metabolic reactions involved in aerobic cellular respiration. The outer membrane is smooth, while the inner membrane is highly convoluted, forming folds that enable ATP to be synthesized more efficiently. Lysosomes are membrane-enclosed sacs that contain hydrolytic enzymes that digest material. Lysosomes also play a role in programmed cell death (apoptosis). Vacuoles are membrane-bound sacs that play many different roles. In plant cells, a specialized large vacuole maintains turgor pressure through nutrient and water storage. In animal cells, vacuoles are smaller in size,aremoreplentifulthaninplantcells, and store cellular materials. Chloroplasts are specialized organelles that are found in plants and photosynthetic algae. Chloroplasts contain a double membrane and serve as the location for photosynthesis. Surface area-to-volume ratios affect the ability of a biological system to obtain necessary nutrients, eliminate waste products, acquire or dissipate thermal energy, and otherwise exchange chemicals and energy with the environment. The surface area of the plasma membrane must be large enough to adequately exchange materials. i. The surface area-to-volume ratio can restrict cell size and shape. Smaller cells typically have a higher surface area-to-volume ratio as well as a more efficient change of materials with the environment than do larger cells. ii. As cells increase in volume, the surface area-to-volume ratio decreases and the demand for internal resources increases. iii. More complex cellular structures (e.g., membrane folds) are necessary to adequately exchange materials with the environment. iv.As organisms increase in size,their surface area-to-volume ratio decreases, affecting properties like rate of heat exchange with the environment. Smaller amounts of mass exchange proportionally more heat with the ambient environment than do larger masses. As mass increases, both the surface areato-volume ratio and the rate of heat exchange decrease. There is a relationship between metabolic rate per unit body mass and the size of multicellular organisms; typically, the smaller the organism, the higher the metabolic rate per unit body mass. Phospholipids have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. The polar hydrophilic phosphate regions of the phospholipids are oriented toward the aqueous external or internal environment, while the nonpolar hydrophobic fatty acid regions face each other within the interior of the membrane. Embedded proteins can be hydrophilic (with charged and polar side groups), hydrophobic (with nonpolar side groups), or both. i. Hydrophilic regions of the proteins are either inside the interior of the protein or exposed to the cytosol (cytoplasm). ii. Hydrophobic regions of proteins make up the protein surface that interacts with the fatty acids in the interior membrane. Describe the fluid mosaic model of cell membranes. Plasma membranes consist of a structural framework of phospholipid molecules embedded with proteins, steroids (such as cholesterol in vertebrate animals), glycoproteins, and glycolipids. All of these can move around the surface of the cell within the membrane, as illustrated by the fluid mosaicbmodel. Plasma membranes separate the internal environment of the cell from the external environment. Selective permeability is the result of the plasma membrane having a hydrophobic interior. Small nonpolar molecules, including N 2 , O 2 , and CO 2 , freely pass across the membrane. Hydrophilic substances, such as large polar molecules and ions, move across the membrane through embedded channels and transport proteins. The nonpolar hydrocarbon tails of phospholipids prevent the movement of ions and polar molecules across the membrane. Small polar, uncharged molecules, like H 2O or NH3 (ammonia), pass through the membrane in small amounts. Cell walls of Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi, and plants provide a structural boundary as well as a permeability barrier for some substances to the internal or external cellular environments and protection from osmotic lysis. The selective permeability of membranes allows for the formation of concentration gradients of solutes across the membrane. Passive transport is the net movement of molecules from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration without the direct input of metabolic energy. Active transport requires the direct input of energy to move molecules. In some cases, active transportisutilizedtomovemoleculesfrom regions of low concentration to regions of high concentration. The processes of endocytosis and exocytosis require energy to move large substances or large amounts of substances into and out of cells. i. In endocytosis, the cell takes in large molecules and particulate matter by folding the plasma membrane in on itself and forming new (small) vesicles that engulf material from the external environment. Facilitated diffusion requires transporter channel proteins to enable the movement of charged ions across the membrane. Membranes may be come polarized by the movement of ions across the membrane. ii. Charged ions, including Na (sodium) and K (potassium), require channel proteins to move through the membrane. Facilitated diffusion enables the movement of large polar molecules through membranes with no energy input. In this type of diffusion, substances move down the concentration gradient. Explain how concentration gradients affect the movement of molecules across membranes. External environments can be hypotonic, hypertonic, or isotonic to internal environments of cells. Movement of water can also be described as moving from hypotonic to hypertonic regions. Water moves by osmosis from regions of high water potential to regions of low water potential. Explain how osmoregulatory mechanisms contribute to the health and survival of organisms. Growth and homeostasis are maintained by the constant movement of molecules across membranes. Explain how osmoregulatory mechanisms contribute to the health and survival of organisms. Osmoregulation maintains water balance and allows organisms to control their internal solute composition and water potential. Water moves from regions of low osmolarity or solute concentration to regions of high osmolarity or solute concentration. RELEVANT EQUATION Solute Potential of a Solution: s = −iCRT where: i =ionizationconstant C = molar concentration R = pressure constant R = 0.0831 L bars mol K T =temperatureinKelvin(°C+273) Metabolic energy (such as that from ATP) is required for active transport of molecules and ions across the membrane and to establish and maintain electrochemical gradients. i. Membrane proteins are necessary for active transport. ii. The Na /K pump and ATPase contribute to the maintenance of the membrane potential. Membranes and membrane-bound organelles in eukaryotic cells compartmentalize intracellular metabolic processes and specific enzymatic reactions. Internal membranes facilitate cellular processes by minimizing competing interactions and by increasing the surface area where reactions can occur. Membrane-bound organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved from once free-living prokaryotic cells via endosymbiosis. Prokaryotes typically lack internal membrane-bound organelles but have internal regions with specialized structures and functions. Eukaryotic cells maintain internal membranes that partition the cell into specialized regions."
