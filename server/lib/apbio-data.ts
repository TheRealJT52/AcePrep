    title: "Chemistry of Life",
    period: "Unit 1",
    topic: "Structure of Water and Hydrogen Bonding, Elements of Life, Introduction to Biological Macromolecules, Properties of Biological Macromolecules",
    content: "Unit 1 explores the chemical foundation of life. Water's unique properties due to hydrogen bonding make it essential for biological processes including cohesion, adhesion, and its role as a universal solvent. The elements of life (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur) form the basis of biological macromolecules. Students examine the structure and function of carbohydrates (monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides), lipids (fats, phospholipids, steroids), proteins (amino acids, peptide bonds, protein folding), and nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, nucleotides). The relationship between molecular structure and function is emphasized throughout, including how changes in structure can affect biological activity."

    title: "Cell Structure and Function",
    period: "Unit 2", 
    topic: "Cell Structures and their Functions, Cell Size and Scale, Plasma Membranes, Membrane Permeability and Transport, Compartmentalization and its Origins",
    content: "Unit 2 examines cellular organization and function. Cell theory states that all living things are composed of cells, the cell is the basic unit of life, and all cells come from pre-existing cells. Students compare prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell structures, including organelles like nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and their specific functions. The plasma membrane's selective permeability is analyzed, including passive transport (diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion) and active transport mechanisms. Surface area to volume ratio constraints on cell size are explored. The endosymbiotic theory explains the evolutionary origin of eukaryotic organelles. Students investigate how compartmentalization allows for specialized cellular functions and metabolic efficiency."

    title: "Cellular Energetics",
    period: "Unit 3",
    topic: "Enzyme Structure and Function, Introduction to Metabolism, Cellular Respiration, Photosynthesis",
    content: "Unit 3 focuses on energy transformations in living systems. Enzymes as biological catalysts lower activation energy and increase reaction rates. Enzyme structure-function relationships, including active sites, induced fit, and factors affecting enzyme activity (temperature, pH, inhibitors) are examined. Cellular respiration converts glucose to ATP through glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and electron transport chain, with oxygen as the final electron acceptor. Photosynthesis captures light energy to produce glucose through light-dependent reactions (photosystems, electron transport, ATP synthesis) and light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). Students analyze the complementary relationship between photosynthesis and cellular respiration in energy flow through ecosystems. The role of ATP as the energy currency of cells is emphasized throughout metabolic pathways."

    title: "Cell Communication and Cell Cycle",
    period: "Unit 4",
    topic: "Cell Communication, Signal Transduction, Changes in Signal Transduction Pathways, Feedback, Cell Cycle, Regulation of Cell Cycle",
    content: "Unit 4 explores how cells communicate and reproduce. Cell communication involves signal molecules (hormones, neurotransmitters), receptors, and response pathways. Signal transduction pathways include reception, transduction through protein cascades, and cellular response. Students examine how changes in signal transduction can lead to disease, including cancer. Feedback mechanisms (positive and negative) regulate cellular processes and maintain homeostasis. The cell cycle consists of interphase (G1, S, G2) and mitotic phase (mitosis and cytokinesis). Cell cycle regulation involves checkpoints controlled by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Disruption of cell cycle control can lead to cancer. Students investigate how external factors (growth factors, density-dependent inhibition) and internal factors (DNA damage checkpoints) regulate cell division."

    title: "Heredity",
    period: "Unit 5",
    topic: "Meiosis and Genetic Diversity, Mendelian Genetics, Non-Mendelian Genetics",
    content: "Unit 5 examines the mechanisms of inheritance. Meiosis reduces chromosome number from diploid to haploid, creating genetic diversity through independent assortment and crossing over. Students analyze Mendel's laws of inheritance: segregation and independent assortment. Monohybrid and dihybrid crosses demonstrate dominant and recessive allele relationships. Non-Mendelian inheritance patterns include incomplete dominance, codominance, multiple alleles, polygenic inheritance, and sex-linked traits. Students investigate how meiotic errors (nondisjunction) can lead to chromosomal abnormalities. The relationship between genotype and phenotype is explored, including how environmental factors can influence gene expression. Pedigree analysis helps trace inheritance patterns through generations."

    title: "Gene Expression and Regulation",
    period: "Unit 6",
    topic: "DNA and RNA Structure and Function, Gene Expression and Regulation, Gene Expression and Cell Specialization, Mutations",
    content: "Unit 6 explores how genetic information is expressed and regulated. DNA structure (double helix, complementary base pairing) allows for accurate replication and information storage. RNA types (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA) have distinct roles in protein synthesis. Gene expression involves transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein), with the genetic code determining amino acid sequences. Gene regulation occurs at multiple levels: transcriptional control (promoters, enhancers, transcription factors), post-transcriptional modifications, and post-translational modifications. Cell specialization results from differential gene expression during development. Students examine mutations (point mutations, chromosomal aberrations) and their effects on protein function and phenotype. Biotechnology applications including PCR, gel electrophoresis, and genetic engineering are explored."

  {
    title: "Natural Selection",
    period: "Unit 7",
    topic: "Introduction to Natural Selection, Natural Selection, Artificial Selection, Population Genetics, Hardy-Weinberg",
    content: "Unit 7 examines evolutionary mechanisms and population genetics. Natural selection acts on phenotypic variation within populations, with individuals having favorable traits being more likely to survive and reproduce. Darwin's theory includes variation, heritability, differential survival and reproduction, and change in populations over time. Types of natural selection include directional, stabilizing, and disruptive selection. Artificial selection demonstrates how selective pressure can rapidly change populations. Population genetics describes allele and genotype frequencies using the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which serves as a null hypothesis for evolutionary change. Factors that disrupt Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium include mutations, gene flow, genetic drift, non-random mating, and natural selection. Students calculate allele frequencies and predict genotype frequencies under various conditions."

    title: "Ecology",
    period: "Unit 8",
    topic: "Responses to the Environment, Energy Flow Through Ecosystems, Population Ecology, Community Ecology, Biodiversity",
    content: "Unit 8 explores ecological relationships and environmental interactions. Organisms respond to environmental stimuli through behavioral and physiological mechanisms. Energy flows through ecosystems from producers to consumers, with energy transfer efficiency decreasing at higher trophic levels. Population ecology examines factors affecting population size, including carrying capacity, limiting factors, and growth patterns (exponential vs. logistic). Community ecology studies species interactions including competition, predation, mutualism, and commensalism. Biodiversity encompasses genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity, with higher diversity generally correlating with ecosystem stability. Students investigate how human activities impact ecosystems through habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and invasive species. Conservation strategies aim to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem services essential for human survival."
