        title: "Early Contacts Among Groups in North America",
        period: "Period 1, 1491-1607",
        topic: "Native American societies before European contact, European exploration in the New World, The Columbian Exchange, Labor, slavery, and caste in the Spanish colonial system, Cultural interactions between Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans",
        content: "The spread of maize cultivation from present day Mexico northward into the present-day American Southwest and beyond supported economic development, settlement, advanced irrigation, and social diversification among societies.  Societies responded to the aridity of the Great Basin and the grasslands of the western Great Plains by developing largely mobile lifestyles. In the Northeast, the Mississippi River Valley, and along the Atlantic seaboard, some societies developed mixed agricultural and hunter-gatherer economies that favored the development of permanent villages. Societies in the Northwestern present-day California supported themselves by hunting and gathering, and in some areas developed settled communities supported by the vast resources of the ocean. - European nations' efforts to explore and conquer the New World stemmed from a search for new sources of wealth, economic and military competition, and a desire to spread Christianity. The Columbian Exchange brought new crops to Europe from the Americas, stimulating European population growth, and new sources of mineral wealth, which facilitated the European shift from feudalism to capitalism. Improvements in maritime technology and more organized methods for conducting international trade,such as joint-stock companies, helped drive changes to economies in Europe and the Americas. Spanish exploration and conquest of the Americas were accompanied and furthered by widespread deadly epidemics that devastated native populations and by the introduction of crops and animals not found in the Americas. - In the encomienda system, Spanish colonial economies marshaled Native American labor tosupportplantation-basedagricultureand extract precious metals and other resources. European traders partnered with some West African groups who practiced slavery to forcibly extract enslaved laborers for the Americas. The Spanish imported enslaved Africans to labor in plantation agriculture and mining. The Spanish developed a caste system that incorporated,and carefully defined the status of the diverse population of Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans in their empire.- In their interactions, Europeans and Native Americans asserted divergent worldviews regarding issues such as religion, gender roles, family, land use, and power. Mutual misunderstandings between Europeans andNativeAmericansoftendefinedtheearly years of interaction and trade as each group sought to make sense of the other. Over time, Europeans and Native Americans adopted some useful aspects of each other's culture. As European encroachments on Native Americans' lands and demands on their labor increased, native peoples sought to defend and maintain their political sovereignty, economic prosperity, religious beliefs, and concepts of gender relations through diplomatic negotiations and military resistance."

        title: "Colonial America",
        period: "Period 2, 1607-1754",
        topic: "How different European colonies developed and expanded, Transatlantic trade, Interactions between American Indians and Europeans, Slavery in the British colonies, Colonial society and culture",
        content: "- Spanish efforts to extract wealth from the land led them to develop institutions based on subjugating native populations, converting them to Christianity, and incorporating them, along with enslaved and free Africans, into Spanish colonial society. - French and Dutch colonial efforts involved relatively few Europeans and relied on trade alliances and intermarriage with American Indians to build economic and diplomatic relationships and acquire furs and other products for export to Europe. English Colonization Efforts Attracted a comparatively large number of male and female British migrants, as well as other European migrants, all of whom sought social mobility, economic prosperity, religious freedom, and improved living conditions. These colonists focused on agriculture and settled on land taken from Native Americans from whom they lived separately. - The Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies grew prosperous exporting tobacco—a labor intensive product initially cultivated by white, mostly male indentured servants and later by enslaved Africans. The New England colonies, initially settled by Puritans, developed around small towns with family farms and achieved a thriving mixed economy of agriculture and commerce. The middle colonies supported a flourishing export economy based on cereal crops and attracted a broad range of European migrants, leading to societies with greater cultural, ethnic, and religious diversity and tolerance. The colonies of the southern Atlantic coast and the British West Indies used long growing seasons to develop plantation economies based on exporting staple crops. They depended on the labor of enslaved Africans, who often constituted the majority of the population in these areas and developed their own forms of cultural and religious autonomy. - An Atlantic economy developed in which goods, as well as enslaved Africans and American Indians, were exchanged between Europe, Africa, and the Americas through extensive trade networks. European colonial economies focused on acquiring, producing, and exporting commodities that were valued in Europe and gaining new sources of labor. Continuing trade with Europeans increased the flow of goods in and out of American Indian communities, stimulating cultural and economic changes and spreading epidemic diseases that caused radical demographic shifts. The British government increasingly attempted to incorporate its North American colonies into a coherent, hierarchical, and imperial structure in order to pursue mercantilist economic aims, but conflicts with colonists and American Indians led to erratic enforcement of imperial policies. - Interactions between European rivals and American Indian populations fostered both accommodation and conflict. French,Dutch, British, and Spanish colonies allied with and armed American Indian groups, who frequently sought alliances with Europeans against other American Indian groups. British conflicts with American Indians over land, resources, and political boundaries led to military confrontations, such as Metacom's War (King Philip's War) in New England. American Indian resistance to Spanish colonizing efforts in North America, particularly after the Pueblo Revolt, led to Spanish accommodation of some aspects of American Indian culture in the Southwest. - All the British colonies participated to varying degrees in the Atlantic slave trade due to the abundance of land and a growing European demand for colonial goods, as well as a shortage of indentured servants. Small New England farms used relatively few enslaved laborers, all port cities held significant minorities of enslaved people, and the emerging plantation systems of the Chesapeake and the southern Atlantic coast had large numbers of enslaved workers, while the great majority of enslaved Africans were sent to the West Indies. As chattel slavery became the dominant labor system in many southern colonies, new laws created a strict racial system that prohibited interracial relationships and defined the descendants of African American mothers as black and enslaved in perpetuity. - The presence of different European religious and ethnic groups contributed to a significant degree of pluralism and intellectual exchange, which were later enhanced by the first Great Awakening and the spread of European Enlightenment ideas. The British colonies experienced a gradual Anglicization Over time, developing autonomous political communities based on English models with influence from intercolonial commercial ties, the emergence of a transatlantic print culture, and the spread of Protestant evangelicalism."

        title: "Revolution and the Young Republic",
        period: "Period 3, 1754-1800",
        topic: "The Seven Years' War, The American Revolution, The Articles of Confederation, The creation and ratification of the Constitution, Developing an American identity, Immigration to and migration within America",
        content: "- French and Indian war, Colonial rivalry intensified between Britain and France in the mid-18th century, as the growing population of the British colonies expanded into the interior of North America, threatening French–Indian trade networks and American Indian autonomy. Britain achieved a major expansion of its territorial holdings by defeating the French, but at tremendous expense, setting the stage for imperial efforts to raise revenue and consolidate control over the colonies. After British victory,imperial officials' attempts to prevent colonists from moving westward generated colonial opposition, while native groups sought to both continue trading with Europeans and resist the encroachments of colonists on tribal lands. - The imperial struggles of the mid-18th century, as well as new British efforts to collect taxes without direct colonial representation or consent and to assert imperial authority in the colonies, began to unite the colonists against perceived and real constraints on their economic activities and political rights. Colonial leaders based their calls for resistance to Britain on arguments about the rights of British subjects, the rights of the individual, local traditions of self-rule,and the ideas of the Enlightenment. The effort for American independence was energized by colonial leaders such as Benjamin Franklin, as well as by popular movements that included the political activism of laborers, artisans, and women. In the face of economic shortages and the British military occupation of some regions, men and women mobilized in large numbers to provide financial and material support for the Patriot movement. - Enlightenment ideas and philosophy inspired many American political thinkers to emphasize individual talent over hereditary privilege, while religion strengthened Americans' view of themselves as a people blessed with liberty. The colonists' belief in the superiority of republican forms of government based on the natural rights of the people found expression in Thomas Paine's Common Sense and the Declaration of Independence. The ideas in these documents resonated throughout American history, shaping Americans' understanding of the ideals on which the nation was based. - Despite considerable loyalist opposition, as well as Great Britain's apparently overwhelming military and financial advantages, the Patriot cause succeeded because of the actions of colonial militias and the Continental Army, George Washington's military leadership, the colonists' ideological commitment and resilience, and assistance sent by European allies. - During and after the American Revolution, an increased awareness of inequalities in society motivated some individuals and groups to call for the abolition of slavery and greater political democracy in the new state and national governments. In response to women's participation in the American Revolution, Enlightenment ideas, and women's appeals for expanded roles, an ideal of \"republican motherhood\" gained popularity. It called on women to teach republican values within the family and granted women a new importance in American political culture. - Many new state constitutions placed power in the hands of the legislative branch and changed as a result of maintained property qualifications for voting and citizenship. The Articles of Confederation united the newly independent states, creating a central government with limited power. After the Revolution,difficulties over international trade, finances, interstate commerce,foreign relations, and internal unrest led to calls for a stronger central government. As settlers moved westward during the 1780s, Congress enacted the Northwest Ordinance for admitting new states; the ordinance promoted public education, the protection of private property, and a ban on slavery in the Northwest Territory. - Delegates from the states participated in the Constitutional Convention and through negotiation, collaboration, and compromise proposed a constitution. The Constitutional Convention compromised over the representation of slave states in Congress and the role of the federal government in regulating both slavery and the slave trade, allowing the prohibition of the international slave trade after 1808. In the debate over ratifying the Constitution, Anti-Federalists opposing ratification battled with Federalists, whose principles were articulated in the Federalist Papers (primarily written by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison). Federalists ensured the ratification of the Constitution by promising the addition of a Bill of Rights that enumerated individual rights and explicitly restricted the powers of the federal government. - Delegates from the states participated in the Constitutional Convention that created a limited but dynamic central government embodying federalism and providing for a separation of powers between its three branches. - The U.S. government forged diplomatic initiatives aimed at dealing with the continued British and Spanish presence in North America, as U.S. settlers migrated beyond the Appalachians and sought free navigation of the Mississippi River. War between France and Britain resulting from the French Revolution presented challenges to the United States over issues of free trade and foreign policy and fostered political disagreement. The Spanish, supported by the bonded labor of the local American Indians, expanded their mission settlements into California; these provided opportunities for social mobility among soldiers and led to new cultural blending. An ambiguous relationship between the federal government and American Indian tribes contributed to problems regarding treaties and American Indian legal claims relating to the seizure of their lands. - During the presidential administrations of George Washington and John Adams, political systems developed and leaders created institutions and precedents that put the principles of the Constitution into practice. Political leaders in the 1790s took a variety of positions on issues such as the relationship between the national government and the states, economic policy, foreign policy, and the balance between liberty and order. This led to the formation of political parties— most significantly the Federalists, led by Alexander Hamilton,and the Democratic- Republican Party,led by Thomas Jeferson and James Madison. George Washington's Farewell Address encouraged national unity, as he cautioned against political factions and warned about the danger of permanent foreign alliances. - Various American Indian groups repeatedly evaluated and adjusted their alliances with Europeans, other tribes, and the United States, and seeking to limit migration of white settlers and maintain control of tribal lands and natural resources. British alliances with American Indians contributed to tensions between the United States and Britain As increasing numbers of migrants from North America and other parts of the world continued to move westward, frontier cultures that had emerged in the colonial period continued to grow, fueling social, political, and ethnic tensions. The expansion of slavery in the deep South and adjacent western lands and rising antislavery sentiment began to create distinctive regional attitudes toward the institution."

        title: "The Development of the Republic",
        period: "Period 4, 1800-1848",
        topic: "The rise of political parties American foreign policy, Innovations in technology, agriculture, and business, Debates about federal power, The Second Great Awakening, Reform movements, The experience of African Americans",
        content: "The period from 1800 to 1848 was marked by the solidification of American democracy, the expansion of federal authority, major regional transformations, and the emergence of reform movements that reshaped American society. The election of 1800, often referred to as the \"Revolution of 1800,\" set the tone. Thomas Jefferson's victory over John Adams symbolized a peaceful transition of power from the Federalist to the Democratic-Republican Party, a major test for the young republic. In his inaugural address, Jefferson emphasized unity and democratic principles. The Jeffersonian era witnessed westward expansion—notably the Louisiana Purchase (1803), which doubled the size of the United States—and debates over federal authority. Jefferson and James Madison sought to limit federal power, as seen in their opposition to the Bank of the United States and Madison's veto of the National Road. However, they also exercised federal authority when politically expedient. The War of 1812, sparked by disputes over American neutral rights and British impressment of American sailors, bolstered American nationalism despite its military mixed results. The post-war period (1815-1825), known as the \"Era of Good Feelings,\" saw one-party rule under James Monroe. The Panic of 1819 revealed economic vulnerabilities. The Missouri Compromise (1820) temporarily settled tensions over slavery's expansion, admitting Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state while prohibiting slavery north of the 36°30' line in the Louisiana Territory. The Monroe Doctrine (1823) asserted American prominence in the Western Hemisphere. The Market Revolution transformed the American economy through transportation innovations (canals, steamboats, railroads), the cotton gin, and early factories. These developments facilitated regional specialization and deepened the North-South divide. The South expanded cotton production through slave labor, while the North developed manufacturing and commercial agriculture. The Second Great Awakening, a Protestant religious revival, inspired social reform movements addressing temperance, prison reform, education, and women's rights. The Seneca Falls Convention (1848) marked the formal beginning of the women's rights movement. Transcendentalists like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau advocated individualism and nature's spiritual qualities. Utopian communities experimented with alternative social arrangements. Abolitionism gained momentum with William Lloyd Garrison's The Liberator and Frederick Douglass's powerful antislavery advocacy. Meanwhile, African Americans faced increased restrictions in both North and South. Free Blacks established separate institutions to resist discrimination. Under Andrew Jackson (1829-1837), American democracy expanded through broader white male suffrage while simultaneously limiting rights for minorities. Jackson's \"spoils system\" rewarded political supporters with government positions. The removal of Native Americans from the Southeast to territories west of the Mississippi through the Indian Removal Act (1830) led to the tragic \"Trail of Tears.\" Jackson's \"Bank War\" against the Second Bank of the United States reflected his populist stance against concentrated financial power. Jackson's successor, Martin Van Buren, faced the Panic of 1837, which ushered in a severe depression. By the 1840s, conflicts over territorial expansion, slavery, and federal power intensified. Under the concept of \"Manifest Destiny,\" Americans believed they had a divine right to expand across the continent. The annexation of Texas (1845) and Mexican-American War (1846-1848) added vast western territories while fueling debates about slavery's expansion into these regions. The Wilmot Proviso, though never enacted, proposed banning slavery in territories acquired from Mexico, highlighting growing sectional tensions. By 1848, the foundations were laid for the sectional crisis that would ultimately lead to the Civil War. Andrew Jackson and his spoils system, the Indian Removal Act, and the Mexican-American War all contributed to the growing tensions between the North and South; he also had a 'kitchen cabinet' of informal advisors not in the cabinet."

        topic: "Manifest Destiny, The Mexican–American War, Attempts to resolve conflicts over the spread of slavery, The election of 1860 and Southern secession, The Civil War, Reconstruction",
        content: "Unit 5 of APUSH traces the intensifying divisions between North and South over slavery, the eruption of the Civil War, and the turbulent Reconstruction that followed. The period begins with the concept of Manifest Destiny—a powerful ideology that asserted the United States had a divine right to expand westward across the continent. This belief was central to President James K. Polk's administration, which aggressively pursued territorial acquisition. Under Polk, the United States annexed Texas (1845), settled the Oregon boundary dispute with Britain (1846), and acquired the Mexican Cession through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) following the Mexican-American War. These expansions, however, reignited debates over slavery's extension into western territories. The Wilmot Proviso (1846), though never enacted, proposed prohibiting slavery in any territory acquired from Mexico and revealed growing sectional divisions. The Compromise of 1850, engineered by Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and Stephen Douglas, temporarily resolved the crisis through five measures: California's admission as a free state, a stronger Fugitive Slave Act, the organization of New Mexico and Utah territories under popular sovereignty, the abolition of the slave trade in Washington, D.C., and the settlement of the Texas-New Mexico boundary dispute. The Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854), which repealed the Missouri Compromise by allowing popular sovereignty in the Kansas and Nebraska territories, led to violent confrontations in \"Bleeding Kansas.\" The act also catalyzed the formation of the Republican Party, dedicated to preventing slavery's expansion. The Dred Scott decision (1857) further inflamed tensions by declaring that Black people had \"no rights which the white man was bound to respect\" and ruling that Congress could not prohibit slavery in any territory. John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry (1859) intensified Southern fears of slave insurrections. The election of Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860, although he won with only 40% of the popular vote and pledged not to interfere with slavery where it existed, triggered the secession of seven Southern states before his inauguration. Confederate forces fired on Fort Sumter in April 1861, beginning the Civil War. Lincoln's initial focus was preserving the Union rather than ending slavery. The war transformed dramatically with the Emancipation Proclamation (1863), which freed slaves in Confederate-held territories and allowed Black men to serve in Union forces. Major turning points included the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg (July 1863). General William Tecumseh Sherman's \"March to the Sea\" devastated Georgia and the Carolinas, breaking Southern morale. The war fundamentally altered American society and government. It led to increased federal power, industrial acceleration in the North, and the destruction of the plantation system in the South. The Thirteenth Amendment (1865) abolished slavery throughout the United States. Reconstruction (1865-1877) began with Lincoln's lenient Ten Percent Plan, followed by Andrew Johnson's similar approach after Lincoln's assassination. Congressional (Radical) Reconstruction imposed stricter requirements on former Confederate states, including ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed citizenship rights to former slaves. The Fifteenth Amendment prohibited voting discrimination based on race. Reconstruction saw extraordinary political participation by African Americans, with over 1,500 Black officeholders at various levels of government. The Freedmen's Bureau provided education and economic assistance. However, Reconstruction faced fierce resistance from white Southerners through Black Codes, violence (including Ku Klux Klan terrorism), and economic intimidation via sharecropping and tenant farming systems. Reconstruction effectively ended with the Compromise of 1877, which resolved the disputed 1876 presidential election by awarding Republican Rutherford B. Hayes the presidency in exchange for removing federal troops from the South. This compromise abandoned many of Reconstruction's goals and allowed Southern states to impose Jim Crow segregation and disenfranchisement measures that would persist well into the 20th century."

        topic: "The settlement of the West, The 'New South', The rise of industrial capitalism, Immigration and migration, Reform movements, Debates about the role of government",
        content: "Following the Civil War, the United States experienced rapid economic growth, industrial expansion, and urbanization during the Gilded Age—a term coined by Mark Twain to describe the era's glittering surface and underlying corruption. The period saw the rise of big business, increased immigration, labor unrest, and intense political debate over economic and social issues. Industrialization transformed the American economy. Massive railroad expansion, including transcontinental lines, created a national market. New technologies and manufacturing processes enabled mass production of consumer goods. Industrial titans like Andrew Carnegie (steel), John D. Rockefeller (oil), and J.P. Morgan (finance) built vast corporate empires. These \"captains of industry\"—or \"robber barons\" to their critics—employed vertical and horizontal integration to eliminate competition and maximize profits. The era's laissez-faire approach to capitalism allowed for minimal government regulation. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the 14th Amendment protected corporations from government intervention while limiting labor rights, as seen in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and Lochner v. New York (1905). While industrialists amassed unprecedented wealth, workers faced hazardous conditions, long hours, and low wages. Labor activism grew with organizations like the Knights of Labor and American Federation of Labor (AFL). Major labor conflicts such as the Great Railroad Strike (1877), Haymarket Affair (1886), Homestead Strike (1892), and Pullman Strike (1894) often ended violently, with government forces supporting management. Immigration surged during this period. Between 1870 and 1900, over 12 million immigrants entered the United States. Early arrivals came primarily from Northern and Western Europe, while later immigrants increasingly came from Southern and Eastern Europe. These \"new immigrants\" often faced discrimination and nativist hostility. Chinese immigrants, who had come to work on railroads and in mines, became targets of the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)—the first significant restriction on immigration. Urbanization accelerated as rural Americans and immigrants flocked to industrial centers. Cities grew rapidly but haphazardly, creating slums and tenements with deplorable conditions. Political machines like New York's Tammany Hall provided services to the urban poor in exchange for votes, while engaging in corruption and graft. Urban growth also spurred innovations in architecture (skyscrapers) and infrastructure (elevated trains, bridges, water systems). Meanwhile, the American West underwent dramatic transformation. Native Americans faced continued displacement through warfare and broken treaties, culminating in the massacre at Wounded Knee (1890) and the forced assimilation policies of the Dawes Act (1887). The frontier officially \"closed\" according to the 1890 census. Western settlers endured harsh conditions while cultivating commercial agriculture that increasingly integrated with national markets. The South attempted to rebuild as the \"New South,\" promoting industrialization and commercial agriculture. However, the region remained economically behind the North. Southern state governments imposed Jim Crow segregation on African Americans, who also faced widespread disenfranchisement and terror through lynching and violence. Sharecropping and tenant farming trapped many rural Southerners in cycles of debt and poverty. In response to these challenges, reform movements emerged. Social reformers established settlement houses like Hull House, founded by Jane Addams, to assist urban immigrants. The Social Gospel movement applied Christian ethics to social problems. The Populist Party advocated for farmers and workers through proposals like government ownership of railroads, a graduated income tax, and inflation-inducing silver coinage (\"free silver\"). The Women's Christian Temperance Union fought alcohol abuse, while suffragists campaigned for women's voting rights. Political corruption pervaded the federal government, with the spoils system placing party loyalists in government positions regardless of qualification. Presidents of this era were generally weak compared to Congress, with the exception of Grover Cleveland. Political reformers achieved the Pendleton Civil Service Act (1883), which introduced merit-based hiring for some federal positions. The 1890s economic depression and continuing labor unrest intensified debates about government's role in the economy, setting the stage for the Progressive Era that would follow."

        content: "Unit 7 marks a dramatic transformation in American politics, society, and international relations. The Progressive Era emerged in response to the excesses of the Gilded Age. Reformers from both political parties sought to curb the power of corporations, improve living conditions, and make government more responsive. Muckrakers like Upton Sinclair (The Jungle) and Ida Tarbell exposed corporate abuse and social injustices, prompting reforms. Key Progressive legislation included the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act, both passed under Theodore Roosevelt. The Progressive presidents—Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson—expanded federal regulatory power. Roosevelt's Square Deal targeted monopolies (trust-busting), consumer protection, and conservation. Taft pursued antitrust cases and established the Children's Bureau, while Wilson's New Freedom saw the creation of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Trade Commission. The 16th through 19th Amendments established an income tax, direct senatorial elections, prohibition, and women's suffrage, respectively. America's role in world affairs grew. The Spanish-American War (1898) resulted in U.S. acquisition of the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico, signaling a new imperialist phase. The U.S. justified its actions through ideas like the White Man's Burden and Anglo-Saxon superiority. Anti-imperialist voices, including Mark Twain and the Anti-Imperialist League, objected on moral and constitutional grounds. Roosevelt's \"Big Stick\" diplomacy and the construction of the Panama Canal demonstrated assertive foreign policy, while Wilson's later moral diplomacy aimed to spread democracy. World War I marked America's emergence as a global power. Initially neutral, the U.S. entered the war in 1917 due to unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann Telegram. The war effort mobilized the economy and society. The Selective Service Act, War Industries Board, and propaganda campaigns managed manpower and morale. The Espionage and Sedition Acts curtailed dissent, most notably in the case of Schenck v. United States, which upheld limits on free speech during wartime. Wilson's Fourteen Points outlined a vision for postwar peace, emphasizing self-determination, free trade, and the League of Nations. However, the U.S. Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles, reflecting isolationist sentiment. The 1920s, often seen as a conservative backlash, brought a return to laissez-faire policies under presidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover. The decade featured cultural conflict: urban vs. rural, modernism vs. traditionalism. The Scopes Trial (1925) highlighted tensions over evolution and religion. Meanwhile, the Harlem Renaissance celebrated Black culture, and women experienced new freedoms through flapper culture and increased employment. The 1929 stock market crash triggered the Great Depression. Hoover's limited response was seen as inadequate. Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal represented a fundamental shift in the role of government. Programs like the CCC, WPA, and Social Security aimed to provide relief, recovery, and reform. Critics came from both left (Huey Long's Share Our Wealth) and right (business conservatives fearing socialism). The Supreme Court initially struck down key programs but later upheld reforms after FDR's controversial court-packing plan. World War II ended the Depression. After aiding the Allies through Lend-Lease and embargoes, the U.S. entered the war following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. The war effort mobilized the entire economy: women joined the workforce (\"Rosie the Riveter\"), African Americans pushed for the Double V campaign, and Japanese Americans were interned under Executive Order 9066. Major battles included D-Day (1944) and the Pacific island-hopping campaign. The war ended with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, launching the U.S. into a new role as global superpower and beginning the Cold War era."

        content: "Following WWII, the United States emerged as a global superpower locked in ideological and geopolitical conflict with the Soviet Union. The Cold War shaped every aspect of foreign and domestic policy. Containment, articulated by George Kennan, guided efforts to prevent the spread of communism. The Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan committed the U.S. to supporting anti-communist regimes and rebuilding war-torn Europe.In 1949, the Soviet Union's first nuclear test ended America's atomic monopoly, initiating a nuclear arms race. The Korean War (1950-1953) tested containment policy, resulting in a stalemate and divided peninsula. Domestically, the Second Red Scare and McCarthyism created an atmosphere of suspicion and conformity. The House Un-American Activities Committee investigated suspected communists, while Senator Joseph McCarthy made increasingly reckless accusations before being discredited. In 1957, the launch of Sputnik triggered fears of a \"missile gap\" and spurred increased defense and education spending via the National Defense Education Act. The Cold War reached dangerous heights during the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), bringing the superpowers to the brink of nuclear war. The Kennedy and Johnson administrations intensified U.S. involvement in Vietnam, escalating from advisory roles to full combat operations. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (1964) gave President Johnson broad war powers. By 1968, over 500,000 American troops were deployed in Vietnam. The war became increasingly divisive at home, with the anti-war movement growing alongside broader youth counterculture movements. The Tet Offensive (1968), though a tactical failure for North Vietnam, undermined public support for the war. Nixon's policy of Vietnamization and diplomacy with China and the Soviet Union (détente) sought to extract America from Vietnam while maintaining global influence. The 1973 Paris Peace Accords officially ended U.S. involvement, and South Vietnam fell to communist forces in 1975. Postwar economic prosperity transformed American society. The GI Bill enabled returning veterans to attend college and purchase homes, contributing to suburban growth. The baby boom increased the population by 76 million between 1946 and 1964. New highways, shopping centers, and Levittowns facilitated suburban living and consumerism. Television homogenized American culture while consolidating advertising power. The civil rights movement gained momentum in the 1950s and 1960s. Brown v. Board of Education (1954) declared school segregation unconstitutional. Martin Luther King Jr.'s philosophy of nonviolent resistance informed pivotal events like the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the Freedom Rides, and the March on Washington. Civil rights legislation—the Civil Rights Act (1964), Voting Rights Act (1965), and Fair Housing Act (1968)—dismantled legal segregation and discrimination. However, de facto segregation and economic inequality persisted. By the late 1960s, more militant approaches emerged through groups like the Black Panthers and figures such as Malcolm X. The women's movement revived with Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique (1963) and the formation of the National Organization for Women (1966). Activists challenged gender discrimination in employment, education, and law. The counterculture challenged traditional values through music, fashion, and lifestyle. The environmental movement gained traction with Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962) and the first Earth Day (1970). The Great Society programs of the Johnson administration expanded government's role in addressing poverty, education, healthcare, and environmental protection. Medicare and Medicaid provided healthcare for the elderly and poor. However, Vietnam War spending and economic challenges limited the Great Society's full implementation. The 1970s brought economic troubles with stagflation—high unemployment combined with high inflation—exacerbated by the OPEC oil embargo. The Watergate scandal led to President Nixon's resignation in 1974, undermining public trust in government. President Carter faced continued economic challenges, an energy crisis, and the Iran hostage crisis, contributing to a sense of national malaise as the period ended."

        content: "Unit 9 marks the rise of modern conservatism and the reshaping of American domestic and foreign policy. Ronald Reagan's election in 1980 symbolized a rightward shift in American politics. Reaganomics promoted tax cuts, deregulation, and supply-side economics, claiming that reducing government intervention would spur economic growth. Critics argued it widened inequality. Reagan also escalated Cold War tensions before later negotiating with Mikhail Gorbachev, contributing to the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War left the United States as the world's sole superpower. President George H.W. Bush spoke of a \"New World Order\" while managing the first Gulf War (1990-1991) through an international coalition. The 1990s under President Bill Clinton saw economic prosperity fueled by the technology boom and globalization. Clinton declared \"the era of big government is over\" and passed welfare reform while presiding over federal budget surpluses. Meanwhile, partisan polarization intensified, culminating in Clinton's impeachment over the Monica Lewinsky scandal. In foreign affairs, the U.S. intervened in humanitarian crises in Somalia, Haiti, and the Balkans with mixed results. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, dramatically altered American policy. President George W. Bush launched the War on Terror, including military operations in Afghanistan (2001) and Iraq (2003). The latter proved particularly controversial, based on ultimately unfounded claims about weapons of mass destruction. Domestically, the PATRIOT Act expanded government surveillance powers, raising civil liberties concerns. The 2008 financial crisis—the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression—led to controversial bank bailouts and the slow recovery that followed. President Barack Obama's election in 2008 marked a historic first as an African American president. His administration passed the Affordable Care Act, expanding healthcare access while generating intense opposition. Obama also navigated the economic recovery, withdrew most troops from Iraq, and increased operations against terrorist groups, including the killing of Osama bin Laden in 2011. Social changes accelerated in the early 21st century. Same-sex marriage gained legal recognition, culminating in the Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges decision (2015). Movements like Black Lives Matter highlighted continued racial disparities in law enforcement and criminal justice. Immigration patterns shifted, with increased migration from Latin America and Asia changing America's demographic composition and spurring political debate. Social media transformed communication, business, and politics while raising concerns about privacy and information quality. The 2016 election of Donald Trump represented another political shift, with his populist approach challenging political norms and conventional Republican positions on trade and foreign policy. His presidency was marked by tax cuts, deregulation, immigration restrictions, trade disputes (particularly with China), and ultimately the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused massive economic disruption and social upheaval beginning in 2020. Climate change emerged as a defining challenge, with scientific consensus on human contributions to global warming contrasting with political disagreement over appropriate responses. Technological advancement accelerated, with artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and renewable energy presenting both opportunities and challenges. As the United States moves further into the 21st century, it continues to navigate tensions between its founding ideals and persistent inequalities, between global leadership and domestic priorities, and between traditional values and evolving social norms."

        title: "Document Analysis",

        topic: "Exam skills",
        content: "Document analysis is a critical skill for success on the AP U.S. History exam, particularly for the Document-Based Question (DBQ) and certain multiple-choice questions. This involves understanding historical sources in their context, evaluating their reliability and purpose, and connecting them to broader historical themes. When analyzing primary sources, consider the following: AUTHOR: Who created the document? What was their background, perspective, and potential biases? Understanding the author's identity and position in society helps evaluate the reliability and perspective of the source. DATE: When was the document created? How does its timing relate to historical events? A document written during an event provides a different perspective than one written years later with the benefit of hindsight. AUDIENCE: Who was the intended audience? How might this have influenced what the author included or omitted? Documents created for public consumption often differ from private communications. PURPOSE: Why was the document created? Was it to inform, persuade, entertain, or record? Understanding the author's goals helps evaluate the content and tone. CONTENT: What information, arguments, or perspectives does the document provide? What specific details, language, or evidence does the author use? These elements reveal both explicit messages and implicit assumptions. CONTEXT: How does the document relate to the broader historical developments of its time? What events or trends might have influenced its creation? No document exists in isolation from its historical moment. POINT OF VIEW: What perspective or worldview does the document represent? What assumptions does it make? Identifying the author's values and beliefs helps understand their interpretation of events. RELIABILITY: How trustworthy is the document as historical evidence? What limitations does it have? All sources have strengths and weaknesses as historical evidence. For secondary sources (historical interpretations), consider how historians use evidence to construct arguments. Identify their thesis, evaluate their use of evidence, and consider alternative interpretations. On the AP Exam, you'll need to synthesize multiple documents to develop a thesis that addresses a historical question. Look for patterns, contradictions, and relationships among sources. When evaluating documents, avoid presentism (judging the past by present standards) while still critically assessing historical perspectives. Remember that what documents omit can be as significant as what they include. Silences about certain issues or groups often reflect power dynamics and cultural assumptions. Practice developing skills in sourcing (identifying who created a source and why), contextualizing (placing sources in their historical context), corroborating (comparing multiple sources), and close reading (analyzing word choice and tone). Through careful document analysis, you'll develop deeper historical understanding and stronger argumentative skills for the AP U.S. History exam."

        title: "Historical Thinking Skills",
        period: "Exam skills",
        topic: "Exam skills",
        content: "The AP U.S. History course emphasizes nine specific historical thinking skills, organized into four skill categories: Skill Category 1: Analyzing Historical Sources and Evidence - Skill 1: Analyzing Primary Sources - Students analyze historians' interpretations, historical sources, and propositions about history. - In analyzing primary sources, students identify their author's point of view, purpose, historical situation, or audience. - Example task: Analyze how the rhetoric in President Wilson's 1917 war message reflected Progressive Era ideals while mobilizing American support for World War I. - Skill 2: Analyzing Secondary Sources - Students analyze historians' interpretations of historical events using evidence to support or refute a claim. - Example task: Compare Howard Zinn's and Paul Johnson's interpretations of the New Deal, evaluating their evidence and reasoning. Skill Category 2: Making Historical Connections - Skill 3: Comparison - Students compare historical developments across time and geography, identifying similarities and differences. - Example task: Compare the goals and strategies of the early civil rights movement (1900-1940) with those of the Black Power movement (1966-1975). - Skill 4: Contextualization - Students situate historical events or processes within their broader historical context. - Example task: Explain how social, economic, and political conditions of the 1920s contributed to the Great Depression. - Skill 5: Synthesis - Students make connections between different course themes and historical periods, or between historical events and the present. - Example task: Explain how the debate over federal power during the Early Republic continues to influence contemporary political discourse. Skill Category 3: Chronological Reasoning - Skill 6: Causation - Students identify, analyze, and evaluate multiple causes and effects of historical developments. - Students distinguish between long-term and short-term causes and effects. - Example task: Analyze both the immediate and underlying causes of the American Revolution. - Skill 7: Patterns of Continuity and Change - Students identify patterns of continuity and change over time, explaining their historical significance. - Example task: Analyze continuities and changes in U.S. immigration policy from 1924 to 1965. Skill Category 4: Creating and Supporting a Historical Argument - Skill 8: Argumentation - Students develop meaningful and persuasive historical arguments, supporting claims with specific and relevant evidence. - Students organize an argument with a clear thesis and logical organization. - Example task: Develop an argument addressing whether the 1950s were primarily characterized by conformity or social change. - Skill 9: Appropriate Use of Historical Evidence - Students use relevant historical evidence to substantiate arguments. - Students evaluate evidence for its relevance, reliability, and ability to support or challenge particular claims. - Example task: Use specific historical evidence to support an argument about the effectiveness of the Progressive movement in addressing social and economic problems. Effective preparation for the AP exam requires practicing all nine skills. When answering essay questions, be sure to: 1. Develop a clear thesis that directly addresses all parts of the prompt 2. Support arguments with specific historical evidence from throughout U.S. history 3. Apply relevant historical thinking skills (such as causation, comparison, or contextualization) 4. Consider multiple perspectives when relevant 5. Organize essays logically, with clear paragraphs and transitions Multiple-choice and short-answer questions will also test these skills, requiring analysis of historical texts, data, images, and maps. Regular practice with diverse historical sources will strengthen your ability to apply these critical thinking skills on the exam."

        title: "Long Essay Question Strategies",
        period: "Exam skills",
        topic: "Exam skills",
        content: "The Long Essay Question (LEQ) on the AP U.S. History exam requires you to develop a complex argument about a significant historical topic. Worth 15% of your total exam score, the LEQ tests your ability to craft a sophisticated thesis, analyze historical evidence, and apply historical thinking skills. You'll have a choice between two prompts, each focused on different time periods. The LEQ rubric evaluates your essay on the following criteria: 1. THESIS (1 point): Develop a historically defensible, evaluative thesis that establishes a line of reasoning. - Your thesis should directly address all aspects of the prompt. - It should make a historical claim that establishes a line of reasoning, not merely restate the prompt. - Place your thesis in either your introduction or conclusion. - Example prompt: Evaluate the extent to which the Progressive movement (1890-1920) addressed the problems created by industrialization and urbanization. - Weak thesis: \"The Progressive movement tried to address many problems in America.\" (Too vague) - Strong thesis: \"While the Progressive movement successfully addressed some problems of industrialization through antitrust legislation and workplace protections, it largely failed to solve urban housing crises and often overlooked racial inequalities, revealing the movement's significant limitations.\" (Evaluative, establishes reasoning) 2. HISTORICAL CONTEXT (1 point): Describe a broader historical context relevant to the prompt. - Establish the historical setting by explaining developments preceding, during, or following the period under discussion. - Connect these developments to your argument. - Example: When discussing the Progressive Era, you might contextualize by explaining how Gilded Age industrialization, corruption, and inequalities created conditions that Progressives sought to address. 3. HISTORICAL THINKING SKILL (2 points): Demonstrate the historical thinking skill targeted in the prompt (causation, comparison, continuity/change). - Each prompt targets a specific skill—identify and focus on it. - Address both aspects of complex skills (causes AND effects, continuities AND changes, or similarities AND differences). - Example for causation: Discuss both immediate triggers and deeper underlying causes of an event, plus both short-term and long-term consequences. 4. EVIDENCE (2 points): Support your argument with specific and relevant examples. - Use specific historical examples rather than vague generalizations. - Include names, dates, legislation, events, etc., that directly support your argument. - For full credit (2 points), provide substantial and varied evidence throughout your essay. - For partial credit (1 point), offer some specific examples but with limited variety or relevance. 5. COMPLEXITY (1 point): Demonstrate a complex understanding of the historical development. - Achieve this by doing ONE of the following: - Explaining relevant nuance by analyzing multiple variables - Explaining both similarity and difference, both continuity and change, or multiple causes - Explaining multiple perspectives - Qualifying or modifying your main argument - Using evidence to corroborate, qualify, or modify an argument Time management is crucial—aim to spend no more than 35-40 minutes on the LEQ. Structure your essay with a clear introduction containing your thesis, body paragraphs organized around supporting points, and a conclusion that reinforces your argument. Avoid common mistakes: writing a narrative without an argument, providing insufficient specific evidence, misidentifying the historical thinking skill, or focusing on the wrong time period. With practice and attention to the rubric criteria, you can master the LEQ and strengthen your overall performance on the AP U.S. History exam."
