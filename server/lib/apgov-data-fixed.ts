    title: "Foundations of American Democracy",
    period: "Unit 1",
    topic: "Democratic ideals, Constitutional foundations, Representative democracy",
    content: "§ Thomas Hobbes's definition of an anarchic 'state of nature' in the absence of government, as in the failed state of Somalia § The Mayflower Compact (1620) § John Locke's Second Treatise of Civil Government (1690) The U.S. government is based on the following democratic ideals: i. Natural rights (all people have certain rights that cannot be taken away) ii. A social contract (an implicit agreement among the people in a society to give up some freedoms to maintain social order) iii. Popular sovereignty (all government power comes from the consent of its people) iv. Limited government (a government's power cannot be absolute) The ideal of limited government is ensured by the interaction of these principles: i. Separation of powers ii. Checks and balances iii. Federalism iv. Republicanism The Declaration of Independence, drafted by Thomas Jefferson (with help from Adams and Franklin), restates the philosophy of natural rights, and provides a foundation for popular sovereignty. The U.S. Constitution, drafted by James Madison at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia that was led by George Washington (with important contributions from Hamilton and members of the 'Grand Committee'), is an example of a social contract and establishes a system of limited government. The Constitution provides the blueprint for a unique form of democratic government in the United States. Representative democracies can take several forms including the following models: i. Participatory democracy, which emphasizes broad participation in politics and civil society ii. Pluralist democracy, which emphasizes group-based activism by nongovernmental interests striving for impact on political decision making iii. Elite democracy, which emphasizes limited participation in politics and civil society Different aspects of the U.S. Constitution as well as the debate between Federalist No. 10 and Brutus No. 1 reflect the tension between the broad participatory model and the more filtered participation of the pluralist and elite models of representative democracy. The three models of representative democracy continue to be reflected in contemporary institutions and political behavior. Describe political principles, institutions, processes, policies, and behaviors. Federalists supported ratification of the Constitution and a strong central government. Madison's arguments in Federalist No. 10 focused on the superiority of a large republic in controlling the 'mischiefs of faction,' delegating authority to elected representatives and dispersing power between the states and national government. Anti-Federalists opposed the ratification of the Constitution and wanted more power reserved to state governments rather than a strong central government. Anti-Federalist writings, including Brutus No. 1, adhered to popular democratic theory that emphasized the benefits of a small, decentralized republic while warning of the dangers to personal liberty from a large, centralized government."

    title: "Interactions Among Branches of Government",
    period: "Unit 2",
    topic: "Congressional representation, trustee and delegate models, legislative process",
    content: "Republicanism, the democratic principle that the will of the people is reflected in government debates and decisions by their representatives, is shown in the bicameral structure of Congress. The Senate is designed to represent states equally, while the House is designed to represent the people. Different membership sizes influence the formality of debate in each chamber. Debate in the House, which has 435 members, is more formal than in the Senate, with 100 members. Interactions in Congress are affected by the two-party system and term-length differences. One-third of the Senate is elected every two years, creating a continuous legislative body. All House members are elected every two years. The enumerated and implied powers in the Constitution allow Congress to participate in the public policy process by: i. Passing a federal budget, raising revenue by laying and collecting taxes, borrowing money, and coining money ii. Declaring war and providing the funds necessary to maintain the armed forces iii. Determining the process for naturalization by which people can become citizens of the U.S. iv. Regulating interstate commerce v. Creating federal courts and their jurisdictions vi. Enacting legislation under the authority of the necessary and proper clause vii. Conducting oversight of the executive branch, including federal agencies in the bureaucracy The structures and powers of the Senate and House are different by design. This difference directly affects the legislative process. Both chambers refer bills to committees, which conduct hearings and debate and mark up bills with revisions and additions. Leadership in committees is determined by the majority political party. Chamber-specific rules and procedures affect the legislative process. Accountability to constituents in each chamber is affected by how representatives perceive their roles. i. A representative who conceives of their role as a trustee will vote on issues based on their own knowledge and judgement. ii. A representative acting as a delegate sees themselves as an agent of those who elected them and will vote on issues based on the interests of their constituents. iii. A politico uses a combination of these role conceptions."

    title: "Presidential Powers and the Executive Branch",
    period: "Unit 3",
    topic: "Presidential powers, executive orders, bureaucracy oversight",
    content: "Presidents use powers and perform functions of the office, with support from the Vice President, Cabinet, and Executive Office of the President, to accomplish a policy agenda. The powers of the president include both formal and informal powers. i. Vetoes and pocket vetoes are formal powers that enable the president to check Congress, but vetoes can be overridden with a 2/3 vote while pocket vetoes cannot be overridden with a 2/3 vote. ii. Foreign policy powers that influence relations with foreign nations are both formal (commander-in-chief and treaties) and informal (executive agreements). iii. Bargaining and persuasion are informal powers that enable the president to secure congressional action. iv. Executive orders allow the president to manage the federal government and are implied by the president's vested executive power or by power delegated by Congress. v. Signing statements are informal powers that inform Congress and the public of the president's interpretation of laws passed by Congress and signed by the president. Senate confirmation is an important check on appointment powers but there can be a potential for conflict based on who is chosen by the president for appointments."
