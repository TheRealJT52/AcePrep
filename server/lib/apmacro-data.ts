    title: "Basic Economic Concepts",
    period: "Unit 1",
    topic: "Scarcity, Resource Allocation, Production Possibilities Curve, Comparative Advantage, Absolute Advantage, Specialization, Trade",
    content: "Unit 1 establishes foundational economic concepts. Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem - resources are limited while wants are unlimited, necessitating choice and opportunity cost. The Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) illustrates trade-offs, efficiency, and economic growth. Students analyze comparative advantage and absolute advantage to understand specialization and gains from trade. The circular flow model depicts interactions between households, firms, government, and international sectors. Market structures ranging from perfect competition to monopoly affect pricing and output decisions. Marginal analysis as a decision-making tool is introduced. Through these concepts, students develop a framework for analyzing macroeconomic activity and policy options."

    title: "Economic Indicators and the Business Cycle",
    period: "Unit 2",
    topic: "Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Unemployment, Inflation, Business Cycles",
    content: "Unit 2 examines how economic performance is measured and analyzed. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measurement includes methods of calculation, components, real versus nominal distinctions, and limitations. Unemployment is analyzed through types (frictional, structural, cyclical), calculation of rates, and natural rate concepts. Inflation is studied through Consumer Price Index measurement, causes (demand-pull, cost-push), and effects on different economic groups. The business cycle model outlines phases of economic fluctuation (expansion, peak, contraction, trough) and their characteristics. This unit provides essential metrics for evaluating macroeconomic conditions and policy effectiveness."

    title: "National Income and Price Determination",
    period: "Unit 3",
    topic: "Aggregate Demand, Aggregate Supply, Macroeconomic Equilibrium, Changes in the AD-AS Model, Fiscal Policy, Automatic Stabilizers",
    content: "Unit 3 presents the aggregate demand-aggregate supply (AD-AS) model to explain macroeconomic equilibrium. Aggregate demand components (consumption, investment, government spending, net exports) and determinants are analyzed. Short-run and long-run aggregate supply are distinguished, with attention to determinants and shifts. The model illustrates how output and price level are determined at equilibrium, with adjustments through short-run and long-run processes. Fiscal policy tools (government spending and taxation) are examined for their impacts on aggregate demand, output, and employment. Automatic stabilizers like progressive taxation and transfer payments moderate business cycles. Students evaluate fiscal policy effectiveness, including multiplier effects, crowding out, and lags in implementation."

    title: "Financial Sector",
    period: "Unit 4",
    topic: "Money, Banking, Financial Assets, Interest Rates, Monetary Policy, The Phillips Curve",
    content: "Unit 4 explores the financial sector's role in the economy. Money's functions (medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account) and measures (M1, M2) are examined. Banking system operations, including fractional reserve banking and money creation through the money multiplier, are analyzed. Financial asset markets for bonds and stocks respond to economic conditions, with price and interest rate relationships. The Federal Reserve System's structure and functions are covered, with focus on monetary policy tools (open market operations, reserve requirements, interest on reserves, discount rate). Monetary policy impacts are traced through interest rates to investment, aggregate demand, and ultimately output and inflation. The Phillips curve illustrates the short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Students evaluate monetary policy effectiveness considering time lags, political independence, and inflation targeting."

    title: "Long-Run Consequences of Stabilization Policies",
    period: "Unit 5",
    topic: "Fiscal and Monetary Policy Actions, Crowding Out, Public Debt, Economic Growth, Federal Reserve and Government Actions",
    content: "Unit 5 examines the long-term impacts of stabilization policies. Fiscal policy effects are analyzed through crowding out, interest rates, and investment. Federal budget policies are evaluated, including deficits, surpluses, and national debt implications. The unit explores economic growth drivers (productivity, physical capital, human capital, technological progress) and growth accounting. Students examine how policy choices affect investment, capital formation, and long-run economic growth. Money growth and inflation relationships are analyzed through the quantity theory of money. The unit covers the Phillips curve's long-run vertical shape, indicating no permanent trade-off between inflation and unemployment. Students evaluate how Federal Reserve credibility and independence affect inflation expectations and policy effectiveness."

    title: "Open Economyâ€“International Trade and Finance",
    period: "Unit 6",
    topic: "Balance of Payments Accounts, Exchange Rates, The Foreign Exchange Market, Effect of Changes in Policies and Economic Conditions on the Foreign Exchange Market, Changes in the Foreign Exchange Market and Net Exports, Real Interest Rates and International Capital Flows",
    content: "Unit 6 explores international economics and open-economy macroeconomics. Balance of payments accounting tracks international transactions through current, capital, and financial accounts. Exchange rate determination through supply and demand in foreign exchange markets is analyzed. Students distinguish between floating and fixed exchange rate systems, including their advantages and disadvantages. The unit examines how monetary policy, fiscal policy, and other factors affect exchange rates. The relationship between exchange rates and net exports is traced through price effects on imports and exports. International capital flows respond to real interest rate differentials between countries. Students evaluate policy choices in open economies, including the trade-offs between domestic objectives and international considerations."

    title: "Model Application and Analysis",
    period: "Exam skills",
    topic: "Exam skills",
    content: "This section focuses on applying economic models to analyze real-world scenarios. Students practice using the aggregate demand-aggregate supply model to predict changes in output, employment, and price level under various economic conditions. The section emphasizes identifying appropriate economic models for different situations (short-run vs. long-run analysis, closed vs. open economy). Graph interpretation skills are developed, including identifying equilibrium points, analyzing shifts, and determining resulting changes in economic variables. Students practice evaluating the effectiveness of economic policies in different scenarios, considering timing, magnitude, and potential unintended consequences. Data analysis skills are emphasized, including interpreting macroeconomic indicators and using them to support arguments about economic conditions. The section also covers analyzing how economic events in one nation can affect global markets through trade linkages, capital flows, and exchange rate mechanisms."

    title: "Economic Policy Analysis",
    period: "Exam skills",
    topic: "Exam skills",
    content: "This section develops skills in analyzing and evaluating economic policies. Students practice comparing the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies under various economic conditions (recession, inflation, stagflation). The section emphasizes identifying appropriate policy responses to specific economic challenges, considering both short-run stabilization and long-run growth objectives. Students learn to evaluate policy proposals using economic criteria such as efficiency, equity, employment effects, price stability, and economic growth. Analysis of policy trade-offs and unintended consequences is emphasized, including domestic and international implications. The section covers comparing alternative viewpoints on economic policies, drawing on different theoretical frameworks (Keynesian, Classical, Monetarist). Students practice constructing evidence-based arguments for or against specific policy actions, and evaluating the effectiveness of historical policy responses to economic crises. The section also addresses the limitations of economic models in policy analysis, including assumptions, data reliability, and measurement challenges."
