    title: "Basic Economic Concepts",
    period: "Unit 1",
    topic: "Scarcity, Resource Allocation, Production Possibilities Curve, Comparative Advantage, Absolute Advantage, Specialization, Trade, Economic Systems",
    content: "Unit 1 establishes foundational economic concepts. Scarcity arises from limited resources and unlimited wants, necessitating choice and opportunity cost. The Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) illustrates concepts of scarcity, opportunity cost, efficiency, and economic growth. Property rights form the foundation for exchange in market economies. Students analyze comparative advantage and absolute advantage to understand specialization and gains from trade. The economic way of thinking emphasizes rational decision-making using marginal analysis. Economic systems (traditional, command, market, mixed) differ in how they answer fundamental questions about what to produce, how to produce, and for whom to produce. Market failure and the role of government in addressing externalities and public goods are introduced. Through these concepts, students develop a framework for analyzing microeconomic decisions and policies."

    title: "Supply and Demand",
    period: "Unit 2",
    topic: "Demand, Supply, Market Equilibrium, Price Controls, Quantity Controls, Tax Incidence and Deadweight Loss",
    content: "Unit 2 examines market forces and their implications. Demand is analyzed through the law of demand, determinants of demand, and movement along versus shifts of the demand curve. Supply follows similar analysis with the law of supply and its determinants. Market equilibrium occurs at the intersection of supply and demand, with market mechanisms eliminating shortages and surpluses. Students explore how changes in demand and supply affect equilibrium price and quantity. Price elasticity concepts (elastic, inelastic, unit elastic) are applied to both demand and supply, with attention to determinants and total revenue implications. Government interventions including price ceilings, price floors, taxes, and subsidies are evaluated for their effects on market outcomes. Consumer and producer surplus are used to analyze market efficiency and deadweight loss. Tax incidence analysis shows how the tax burden is distributed between buyers and sellers based on elasticity."

    title: "Production, Cost, and the Perfect Competition Model",
    period: "Unit 3",
    topic: "Production Function, Short-Run Production Costs, Long-Run Production Costs, Types of Profit, Perfect Competition",
    content: "Unit 3 examines firm production decisions and perfect competition. The production function relates inputs to outputs, with analysis of marginal returns. Short-run production costs include fixed and variable components, with emphasis on marginal and average relationships. Long-run costs reflect all inputs being variable, demonstrated through economies and diseconomies of scale. Economic profit differs from accounting profit by including implicit costs. The perfect competition model assumes many small firms, identical products, perfect information, and free entry/exit. Profit maximization occurs where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Students analyze firm behavior in the short run (continue or shut down) and long run (enter or exit), with profit or loss determining actions. Market supply curves are derived from firm supply decisions. Long-run equilibrium results in normal profit (zero economic profit) due to entry and exit. Market efficiency is analyzed through consumer and producer surplus maximization."

    title: "Imperfect Competition",
    period: "Unit 4",
    topic: "Monopoly, Price Discrimination, Monopolistic Competition, Oligopoly, Game Theory",
    content: "Unit 4 analyzes market structures with market power. Monopoly features a single seller with high barriers to entry, resulting in restricted output and higher prices compared to perfect competition. Monopolistic competition combines many firms selling differentiated products with low barriers to entry, resulting in some price-setting ability but normal profits in the long run. Oligopoly involves few interdependent firms with high barriers to entry, with strategic behavior analyzed through game theory models like the prisoner's dilemma. Students compare these market structures on criteria of number of firms, product differentiation, price-making ability, barriers to entry, and efficiency outcomes. Price discrimination strategies are examined, including requirements and profit implications. Profit maximization across all market structures involves marginal revenue equals marginal cost analysis, but with different marginal revenue curves. The unit addresses efficiency losses from market power through deadweight loss analysis."

    title: "Factor Markets",
    period: "Unit 5",
    topic: "Derived Factor Demand, Marginal Revenue Product, Least-Cost Rule, Profit-Maximizing Rule, Market Distribution of Income",
    content: "Unit 5 examines markets for factors of production (labor, capital, land). Factor demand is derived from the demand for the goods/services they produce. The marginal revenue product represents the additional revenue from employing one more unit of a factor, and forms the basis of the factor demand curve. Profit-maximizing firms employ factors until marginal revenue product equals marginal factor cost. In competitive factor markets, factors earn their marginal revenue product. Monopsony (single buyer) in factor markets results in lower wages and employment compared to competitive markets. Changes in factor demand and supply affect income distribution and return to factors. Students analyze how technology changes, immigration, and market power influence wage determination and income distribution. Resource allocation across sectors reflects the operation of factor markets directing resources to their highest-valued use."

    title: "Market Failure and the Role of Government",
    period: "Unit 6",
    topic: "Socially Efficient and Inefficient Market Outcomes, Externalities, Public and Private Goods, Income Distribution",
    content: "Unit 6 addresses situations where markets fail to achieve efficient outcomes. Externalities occur when production or consumption affects third parties, leading to market failure. Positive externalities like education or research create social benefits exceeding private benefits, resulting in underproduction without intervention. Negative externalities like pollution impose costs on society beyond private costs, resulting in overproduction. Government responses include taxes, subsidies, regulations, and tradable permits. Public goods (non-excludable, non-rivalrous) like national defense suffer from the free-rider problem and market underprovision. Common resources (non-excludable, rivalrous) like fisheries face the tragedy of the commons without proper management. Students evaluate government policies addressing market failures, including their efficiency, equity, and incentive effects. Government intervention to promote equity through taxation and transfer programs involves trade-offs with efficiency objectives."

    title: "Graphical Analysis in Microeconomics",
    period: "Exam skills",
    topic: "Exam skills",
    content: "This section develops skills in using and interpreting graphs for microeconomic analysis. Students practice constructing and interpreting supply and demand graphs to analyze market changes and government interventions. The section emphasizes identifying shifts versus movements along curves and determining resulting changes in equilibrium price and quantity. Students learn to represent and analyze elasticity concepts graphically, including interpreting the slope of curves and areas representing consumer and producer surplus. Cost curve analysis is practiced, including graphing and interpreting relationships between marginal and average cost curves. Students develop skills in graphically comparing different market structures, including perfect competition, monopoly, monopolistic competition, and oligopoly. The section covers using graphs to analyze efficiency and deadweight loss in various scenarios. Students practice identifying profit-maximizing output levels by finding where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, and determining whether firms earn economic profit, normal profit, or economic loss."

    title: "Microeconomic Policy Analysis",
    period: "Exam skills",
    topic: "Exam skills",
    content: "This section focuses on evaluating microeconomic policies and their impacts. Students practice analyzing market interventions such as price controls, taxes, subsidies, and regulations using economic criteria including efficiency, equity, and incentives. The section emphasizes identifying unintended consequences of policies, such as black markets from price ceilings or decreases in quantity transacted from taxation. Students learn to evaluate policies addressing externalities, including comparing the effectiveness of direct regulation versus market-based approaches like Pigouvian taxes and cap-and-trade systems. Analysis of policies related to public goods, common resources, and information asymmetry is covered. The section develops skills in comparing alternative viewpoints on microeconomic policies, drawing on different perspectives about the appropriate role of government in markets. Students practice constructing evidence-based arguments about specific microeconomic policies, incorporating concepts of market efficiency, equity considerations, and potential market failures. The section also addresses limitations in policy analysis, including data reliability, behavioral factors, and potential unintended consequences."
