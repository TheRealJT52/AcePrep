    period: "Unit 1",
    topic: "Limits and Continuity",
    content: "Calculus uses limits to understand and model dynamic change. Because an average rate of change divides the change in one variable by the change in another, the average rate of change is undefined at a point where the change in the independent variable would be zero. The limit concept allows us to define instantaneous rate of change in terms of average rates of change. Given a function f, the limit of f (x) as x approaches c is a real number R if f (x) can be made arbitrarily close to R by taking x sufficiently close to c (but not equal to c). If the limit exists and is a real number, then the common notation is lim f ( x ) = R. x→ c X EXCLUSION STATEMENT The epsilon-delta definition of a limit is not assessed on the AP Calculus AB or BC Exam. However, teachers may include this topic in the course if time permits. A limit can be expressed in multiple ways, including graphically, numerically, and analytically. The concept of a limit includes one sided limits. Graphical information about a function can be used to estimate limits. Because of issues of scale, graphical representations of functions may miss important function behavior. A limit might not exist for some functions at particular values of x. Some ways that the limit might not exist are if the function is unbounded, if the function is oscillating near this value, or if the limit from the left does not equal the limit from the right. One-sided limits can be determined analytically or graphically. Limits of sums, differences, products, quotients, and composite functions can be found using limit theorems. Common ways of manipulating a limit for direct substitution: §§ Factoring and dividing common factors of rational functions §§ Multiplying by an expression involving the conjugate of a sum or difference in order to simplify functions involving radicals §§ Using alternate forms of trigonometric functions It may be necessary or helpful to rearrange expressions into equivalent forms before evaluating limits. The squeeze theorem can be used to show lim x→0 sin x / x= 1; lim x→0 1 − cos x= 0. The limit of a function may be found by using the squeeze theorem. Types of discontinuities include removable discontinuities, jump discontinuities, and discontinuities due to vertical asymptotes. A function f is continuous at x = c provided that f(c) exists, limx →c f ( x ) exists, and lim x →c f ( x ) = f ( c ). A function is continuous on an interval if the function is continuous at each point in the interval. Polynomial, rational, power, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions are continuous on all points in their domains. If the limit of a function exists at a discontinuity in its graph, then it is possible to remove the discontinuity by defining or redefining the value of the function at that point, so it equals the value of the limit of the function as x approaches that point. In order for a piecewise-defined function to be continuous at a boundary to the partition of its domain, the value of the expression defining the function on one side of the boundary must equal the value of the expression defining the other side of the boundary, as well as the value of the function at the boundary. Asymptotic and unbounded behavior of functions can be described and explained using limits. If f is a continuous function on the closed interval [a, b] and d is a number between f (a) and f (b), then the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there is at least one number c between a and b, such that f (c) = d. The Intermediate Value Theorem is used to prove the existence of solutions to equations."

    title: "Differentiation: Definition and Basic Derivative Rules",
    period: "Unit 2",
    topic: "Differentiation: Definition and Basic Derivative Rule",
    content: "Derivatives allow us to determine rates of change at an instant by applying limits to knowledge about rates of change over intervals. The difference quotients f (a + h ) − f (a )/h and f ( x ) − f (a) / x-a express the average rate of change of a function over an interval. The instantaneous rate of change of a function at x = a can be expressed by lim h→0 f (a + h ) − f (a )/h or or lim x →a f ( x ) − f (a)/x −a provided the limit exists. These are equivalent forms of the definition of the derivative and are denoted f ′ (a). The derivative of f is the function whose value at x is lim h→ 0 f ( x + h) − f ( x )/h, provided this limit exists For y = f ( x ), notations for the derivative include dy/dx, f ′( x ), and y ′. The derivative can be represented graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally. The derivative of a function at a point is the slope of the line tangent to a graph of the function at that point. The derivative at a point can be estimated from information given in tables or graphs. Technology can be used to calculate or estimate the value of a derivative of a function at a point. If a function is differentiable at a point, then it is continuous at that point. In particular, if a point is not in the domain of f, then it is not in the domain of f '. A continuous function may fail to be differentiable at a point in its domain. Direct application of the definition of the derivative and specific rules can be used to calculate the derivative for functions of the form f ( x ) = x’ . The power rule says the derivative of x raised to the power of n is n times x raised to the power of n-1. Sums, differences, and constant multiples of functions can be differentiated using derivative rules. The power rule combined with sum, difference, and constant multiple properties can be used to find the derivatives for polynomial functions. Specific rules can be used to find the derivatives for sine, cosine, exponential, and logarithmic functions. In some cases, recognizing an expression for the definition of the derivative of a function whose derivative is known offers a strategy for determining a limit. Derivatives of products of differentiable functions can be found using the product rule. Derivatives of quotients of differentiable functions can be found using the quotient rule. Rearranging tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant functions using identities allows differentiation using derivative rules. The chain rule can be used to find the derivatives of composite functions."

    topic: "Differentiation of composite, Implicit, and Inverse Functions. chain rule, derivative manipulation",
    content: "The chain rule provides a way to differentiate composite functions. The chain rule is the basis for implicit differentiation. The chain rule and definition of an inverse function can be used to find the derivative of an inverse function, provided the derivative exists. The chain rule applied with the definition of an inverse function, or the formula for the derivative of an inverse function, can be used to find the derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions. Differentiating f ′ produces the second derivative f  ″, provided the derivative of f  ′ exists; repeating this process produces higher-order derivatives of f. Higher-order derivatives are represented with a variety of notations. For y = f (x), notations for the second derivative include d^2y/dx^2, f’’(x), and y″. Higher-order derivatives can be denoted d^ny/dx^n or f ^(n)(x)."
