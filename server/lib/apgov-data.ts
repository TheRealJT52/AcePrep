    title: "Foundations of American Democracy",
    period: "Unit 1",
    topic: "§ Thomas Hobbes’s definition of an anarchic “state of nature” in the absence of government, as in the failed state of Somalia § The Mayflower Compact (1620) § John Locke’s Second Treatise of Civil Government (1690) The U.S. government is based on the following democratic ideals: i. Natural rights (all people have certain rights that cannot be taken away) ii. A social contract (an implicit agreement among the people in a society to give up some freedoms to maintain social order) iii. Popular sovereignty (all government power comes from the consent of its people) iv. Limited government (a government’s power cannot be absolute) The ideal of limited government is ensured by the interaction of these principles: i. Separation of powers ii. Checks and balances iii. Federalism iv. Republicanism The Declaration of Independence, drafted by Thomas Jefferson (with help from Adams and Franklin), restates the philosophy of natural rights, and provides a foundation for popular sovereignty. The U.S. Constitution, drafted by James Madison at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia that was led by George Washington (with important contributions from Hamilton and members of the “Grand Committee”), is an example of a social contract and establishes a system of limited government. The Constitution provides the blueprint for a unique form of democratic government in the United States. Representative democracies can take several forms including the following models: i. Participatory democracy, which emphasizes broad participation in politics and civil society ii. Pluralist democracy, which emphasizes group-based activism by nongovernmental interests striving for impact on political decision making iii. Elite democracy, which emphasizes limited participation in politics and civil society Different aspects of the U.S. Constitution as well as the debate between Federalist No. 10 and Brutus No. 1 reflect the tension between the broad participatory model and the more filtered participation of the pluralist and elite models of representative democracy. The three models of representative democracy continue to be reflected in contemporary institutions and political behavior. Describe political principles, institutions, processes, policies, and behaviors. Federalists supported ratification of the Constitution and a strong central government. Madison’s arguments in Federalist No. 10 focused on the superiority of a large republic in controlling the “mischiefs of faction,” delegating authority to elected representatives and dispersing power between the states and national government. Anti-Federalists opposed the ratification of the Constitution and wanted more power reserved to state governments rather than a strong central government. Anti-Federalist writings, including Brutus No. 1, adhered to popular democratic theory that emphasized the benefits of a small, decentralized republic while warning of the dangers to personal liberty from a large, centralized government. Specific incidents and legal challenges that highlighted key weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation are represented by the: i. Lack of centralized military power to address Shays’ Rebellion ii. Lack of an executive branch to enforce laws, including taxation iii. Lack of a national court system iv. Lack of power to regulate interstate commerce v. Lack of the exclusive power to coin money Compromises deemed necessary for ratification of the Constitution included the following: i. Great (Connecticut) Compromise, which created a dual (bicameral) system of congressional representation with the House of Representatives based on each state’s population and the Senate representing each state equally ii. Electoral College, which created a system for electing the president by electors from each state rather than by popular vote or by congressional vote iii. Three-Fifths Compromise, which provided a formula for calculating a state’s enslaved population for purposes of representation in the House and for taxation iv. Postponing until 1808 a decision whether to ban the importation of enslaved persons v. Agreement to add a Bill of Rights to address concerns of the Anti-Federalists Debates about self-government during the drafting of the Constitution necessitated the drafting of an amendment process in Article V that entailed either a two-thirds vote in both houses or a proposal from two-thirds of the state legislatures, with final ratification determined by three-fourths of the states. The compromises necessary to secure ratification of the Constitution left some matters unresolved that continue to generate discussion and debate today. The debate over the role of the national government, the powers of state governments, and the rights of individuals remains at the heart of present-day constitutional issues about democracy and governmental power, as represented by: i. Debates about government surveillance resulting from the federal government’s response to the 9/11 attacks ii. Debates about the role of government in public school education Required Course Content § Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 § Impeachment proceedings against Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Bill Clinton § Congressional response to the Obama administration’s executive actions on immigration The specific and separate powers delegated to Congress, the president, and the courts allow each branch to check and balance the power of the other branches, ensuring no one branch becomes too powerful. Federalist No. 51 explains how constitutional provisions of separation of powers and checks and balances control potential abuses by majorities. Separation of powers and checks and balances creates multiple access points for stakeholders and institutions to influence public policy. Checks and balances and separation of powers allow legal actions to be taken against public officials deemed to have abused their power. Those legal actions include the process of impeachment (the House formally charges an official with abuse of power or misconduct) and removal (if the official is convicted in a Senate impeachment trial). Federalism is the system of government in the United States in which power is shared between the national and state governments. The exclusive and concurrent powers of the national and state governments help explain the ongoing debate over the balance of power between the two levels. Exclusive power is held by only one level of government and includes enumerated powers that are written in the Constitution, and implied powers that are not specifically written in the Constitution but are inferred from the Necessary and Proper Clause. Reserved powers are those not delegated or enumerated to the national government but are reserved to the states, as stated in the Tenth Amendment. Concurrent powers are shared between both levels of government such as the power to collect taxes, the power to make and enforce laws and the power to build roads. The distribution of power between national and state governments is demonstrated by: i. Revenue sharing (national funding with almost no restrictions to the states on its use and is the least used form of funding) ii. Block grants (national funding with minimal restrictions to the states on its use and is preferred by the states) iii. Categorical grants (national funding that is restricted to specific categories of expenditures, is preferred by the national government, and is the most commonly used form of funding) iv. Mandates (requirements by the national government of the states) The Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment give the national government the power to enforce protections for any person against the states, but Supreme Court interpretations can influence the extent of those protections. The Commerce Clause gives the national government the power to regulate interstate commerce, but Supreme Court interpretations can influence the extent of this power. The Necessary and Proper Clause gives Congress the power to make laws related to carrying out its enumerated powers, but Supreme Court interpretations can influence the extent of these powers. The Supremacy Clause gives the national government and its laws general precedence over states’ laws, but Supreme Court interpretations may affect when specific actions exceed this constitutional power. § Daniel Elazar, “Opening the Third Century of American Federalism: Issues and Prospects,” Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science (1990) § New Deal legislation § Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 and state marriage laws § No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 § Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and United States v. Morrison (2000) The allocation of powers between national and state governments creates multiple access points for stakeholders and institutions to influence public policy. National policymaking is constrained by the sharing of concurrent powers with state governments."

    title: "InRepublicanism, the democratic principle that the will of the people is reflected in government debates and decisions by their representatives, is shown in the bicameral structure of Congress. The Senate is designed to represent states equally, while the House is designed to represent the people. Different membership sizes influence the formality of debate in each chamber. Debate in the House, which has 435 members, is more formal than in the Senate, with 100 members. Interactions in Congress are affected by the two-party system and term-length differences. One-third of the Senate is elected every two years, creating a continuous legislative body. All House members are elected every two years. The enumerated and implied powers in the Constitution allow Congress to participate in the public policy process by: i. Passing a federal budget, raising revenue by laying and collecting taxes, borrowing money, and coining money ii. Declaring war and providing the funds necessary to maintain the armed forces iii. Determining the process for naturalization by which people can become citizens of the U.S. iv. Regulating interstate commerce v. Creating federal courts and their jurisdictions vi. Enacting legislation under the authority of the necessary and proper clause vii. Conducting oversight of the executive branch, including federal agencies in the bureaucracy The structures and powers of the Senate and House are different by design. This difference directly affects the legislative process. Both chambers refer bills to committees, which conduct hearings and debate and mark up bills with revisions and additions. Leadership in committees is determined by the majority political party. Chamber-specific rules and procedures affect the legislative process. i. In the House, the Speaker is elected by a majority of members and presides over the legislative work in the House. All revenue bills must originate in the House. Rules for debate in the House on a bill are established by the Rules Committee. The House can form a Committee of the Whole in order to expedite debate on bills. An individual representative in the House can file a discharge petition to have a bill brought to the floor for debate, but it is rarely done. ii. In the Senate, bills are typically brought to the floor by unanimous consent, but a Senator may request a hold on a bill to prevent it from getting to the floor for a vote. During debate, a Senator can use the filibuster (a tactic to prolong debate and delay or prevent a vote on a bill) or make a motion for cloture (a procedure to end a debate). iii. When a bill passed by both chambers on the same topic has variation in its wording, a conference committee meets to reconcile those differences. Congress must generate a budget that addresses both mandatory and discretionary spending. i. Mandatory spending is required by law for entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. ii. Discretionary spending is approved on an annual basis for defense spending, education, and infrastructure. As entitlement costs grow, discretionary spending opportunities will decrease unless tax revenues increase, or the budget deficit increases. Pork-barrel legislation (funding for a local project in a larger appropriation bill) and logrolling (exchange of political favors among legislators, such as trading votes, to gain support for legislation) affect the legislative process in both chambers. Congressional behavior and governing effectiveness are influenced by ideological divisions between political parties. Partisan voting (when members of Congress vote based on their political party affiliation) and polarization (when political attitudes move toward ideological extremes) can lead to gridlock (a situation in which no congressional action on legislation can be taken due to a lack of consensus). Gerrymandering, redistricting, and unequal representation of constituencies have been partially addressed by Supreme Court cases that opened the door for equal protection challenges to redistricting. Elections that have led to a divided government (when one party controls the presidency and the other party controls at least one of the chambers of Congress) can lead to more intense partisanship. This partisanship can result in members of Congress voting against presidential initiatives and appointments, especially those of a lame duck president. Accountability to constituents in each chamber is affected by how representatives perceive their roles. i. A representative who conceives of their role as a trustee will vote on issues based on their own knowledge and judgement. ii. A representative acting as a delegate sees themselves as an agent of those who elected them and will vote on issues based on the interests of their constituents. iii. A politico uses a combination of these role conceptions. Presidents use powers and perform functions of the office, with support from the Vice President, Cabinet, and Executive Office of the President, to accomplish a policy agenda. The powers of the president include both formal and informal powers. i. Vetoes and pocket vetoes are formal powers that enable the president to check Congress, but vetoes can be overridden with a 2/3 vote while pocket vetoes cannot be overridden with a 2/3 vote. ii. Foreign policy powers that influence relations with foreign nations are both formal (commander-in-chief and treaties) and informal (executive agreements). iii. Bargaining and persuasion are informal powers that enable the president to secure congressional action. iv. Executive orders allow the president to manage the federal government and are implied by the president’s vested executive power or by power delegated by Congress. v. Signing statements are informal powers that inform Congress and the public of the president’s interpretation of laws passed by Congress and signed by the president. Senate confirmation is an important check on appointment powers but there can be a potential for conflict based on who is chosen by the president for appointments, including: i. Cabinet members ii. Ambassadors iii. Some positions within the Executive Office of the President iv. Supreme Court Justices, Court of Appeals judges, and District Court judges Senate confirmation is an important check on appointment powers, but the president’s longest lasting influence lies in life-tenured judicial appointments. §§ Conflicts in Vietnam, Iraq, Kosovo, Libya, Syria §§ No Child Left Behind Act (2001) §§ Appointments of Sandra Day O’Connor and Thurgood Marshall §§ Failed appointments: Robert Bork, John Tower, and Abe Fortas Policy conflicts with the congressional agenda (the formal list of policies Congress is considering at any given time) can lead the president to use executive orders and directives to the bureaucracy to address the president’s own agenda items. Federalist No. 70 offers justification for a single executive by arguing a strong executive is “essential to the protection of the country against foreign attacks, to the steady administration of the laws, to the protection of property, and to the security of liberty.” Passage of the Twenty-Second Amendment, which established presidential term limits, demonstrates concern about the expansion of presidential power. Different perspectives on the presidential role, ranging from a limited to a more expansive interpretation and use of power, continue to be debated in the context of contemporary events. The impact of presidential communication has increased with advances in communication technology. i. Modern technology, such as social media, allows for rapid responses to political issues. ii. Nationally broadcast State of the Union messages and the president’s bully pulpit are tools for agenda setting that use the media to influence public views about which policies are the most important. The foundation for powers of the judicial branch and the argument for how its independence checks the power of other branches is set forth in the following documents, respectively: i. Article III of the Constitution ii. Federalist No. 78 Stare decisis (the legal doctrine under which courts follow legal precedents when deciding cases with similar facts) plays an important role in judicial decision making. Life tenure for justices allows the court to function independent of the current political climate. As a result of this independence, the Court can deliver controversial or unpopular court decisions, which in turn can lead to debate about the court’s power. Political discussion about the Supreme Court’s power is illustrated by the ongoing debate over differing interpretations of judicial review. i. Judicial activism asserts that judicial review allows the courts to overturn current Constitutional and case precedent or invalidate legislative or executive acts. ii. Judicial restraint asserts that judicial review should be constrained to decisions that adhere to current Constitutional and case precedent. Restrictions on the Supreme Court are represented by: i. Congressional legislation to modify the impact of prior Supreme Court decisions ii. Ratification of a Constitutional amendment iii. Judicial appointments and confirmations which may shift the ideological balance of the court iv. The president and states delaying implementation of a Supreme Court decision v. Enacting legislation to limit the cases the Supreme Court can hear on appeal by removing the court’s jurisdiction over a case The federal bureaucracy is composed of departments, agencies, commissions, and government corporations that implement policy by: i. Writing and enforcing regulations ii. Issuing fines iii. Testifying before Congress iv. Forming iron triangles (alliances of congressional committees, bureaucratic agencies, and interest groups that are prominent in specific policy areas) v. Creating issue networks (temporary coalitions that form to promote a common issue or agenda) The civil service primarily uses a merit system that prioritizes hiring and promotion based on professionalism, specialization, and neutrality, as opposed to political patronage, whereby bureaucratic jobs are politically appointed. The federal bureaucracy uses discretionary power as delegated by Congress to interpret and implement policies. Through their rulemaking authority, federal bureaucratic agencies utilize their discretion to create and enforce regulations. Bureaucratic agencies include: i. Department of Homeland Security ii. Department of Transportation iii. Department of Veterans Affairs iv. Department of Education v. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) vi. Federal Elections Commission (FEC) vii. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Congressional oversight of the bureaucracy to ensure that legislation is implemented as intended includes: i. Review, monitoring, and supervision of bureaucratic agencies ii. Investigation and committee hearings of bureaucratic activity iii. Power of the purse (the ability of Congress to check the bureaucracy by appropriating or withholding funds) As a means to curtail the use of presidential power, congressional oversight serves as a check of executive authorization. Presidential ideology, authority, and influence affect how executive branch agencies carry out the goals of the administration. Compliance monitoring ensures that funds are being used properly and regulations are being followed. Compliance monitoring can pose a challenge to policy implementation. Formal and informal powers of Congress, the president, and the courts over the bureaucracy are used to maintain its accountability. Explain how the distribution of powers among the three branches of government impacts policymaking. The allocation of powers among the three branches of government creates multiple access points for stakeholders and institutions to influence public policy. National policymaking is constrained by the sharing of powers between the three branches."

    title: "Civil Liberties and Civil Rights",
    period: "UThe U.S. Constitution includes a Bill of Rights specifically designed to protect individual liberties and rights. Civil liberties are constitutionally established guarantees and freedoms that protect citizens, opinions, and property against arbitrary government interference. The application of the Bill of Rights is continuously interpreted by the courts. The Bill of Rights consists of the first ten Amendments to the Constitution, which enumerate the liberties and rights of individuals. The interpretation and application of the First Amendment’s establishment and free exercise clauses reflect an ongoing tension between government power to make law and an individual’s right to religious freedom. The Supreme Court has held that speech, including symbolic speech (nonverbal action that communicates an idea or belief), is protected by the First Amendment. Efforts to balance social order and individual freedom are reflected in interpretations of the First Amendment that limit speech, including: i. Time, place, and manner regulations that impose restrictions such as limits on the time of day an event can be held, limits on where an event can be held, and limits on the noise levels at an event ii. Limitations on some obscene and offensive communication. iii. Protections against defamation (language that harms the reputation of another) including libel (written communication) and slander (oral communication). iv. Restrictions on speech that create a clear and present danger and subsequent interpretations which have refined those restrictions. The Supreme Court bolstered the freedom of the press, affirming support for a heavy presumption against prior restraint even in cases involving national security. The Supreme Court’s decisions on the Second Amendment rest upon its constitutional interpretation of the right to bear arms. Court decisions defining cruel and unusual punishment involve interpretation of the Eighth Amendment and its application to death penalty statutes. The debate about the Second and Fourth Amendments involves concerns about public safety and whether or not the government regulation of firearms or collection of digital metadata promotes or interferes with public safety and individual rights. The doctrine of selective incorporation has imposed limitations on state regulation of civil liberties by extending select protections of the Bill of Rights to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments include clauses which state that the government may not infringe on a person’s right to life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The due process clause in the Fifth Amendment applies to the national government and the due process clause in the Fourteenth Amendment applies to states. Some government interests may justify the restriction of individual rights; for example, speech can be limited when it is shown to present a danger to public safety. Procedural due process requires that government officials use methods that are not arbitrary when making and carrying out decisions affecting constitutionally protected rights. These procedural due process protections are reinforced by key protections enshrined in other provisions of the Bill of Rights and key legal doctrines established by the Supreme Court. For example, the Miranda rule requires accused persons to be informed of some procedural protections found in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments prior to interrogation. However, these procedural protections are not absolute. A public safety exception has been sanctioned by the Court that allows unwarned interrogation to stand as direct evidence in court. Procedural rights of the accused and the prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures are intended to ensure that individual liberties are not eclipsed by the need for social order and security, including: i. The right to legal counsel, speedy and public trial, and an impartial jury ii. Protection against warrantless searches of cell phone data under the Fourth Amendment iii. Limitations placed on bulk collection of telecommunication metadata (Patriot and USA Freedom Acts) Procedural due process also protects the rights of the accused during a trial. The Bill of Rights guarantees the right to an attorney and protection from unreasonable searches and seizures. The exclusionary rule, as decided by the Supreme Court, stipulates that evidence illegally seized by law enforcement officers in violation of the suspect’s Fourth Amendment rights (including the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures) cannot be used against that suspect in criminal prosecution. Over time, the Supreme Court has recognized constitutionally protected rights that are not explicitly listed in the Bill of Rights. These unenumerated rights include the right to privacy. Justices and scholars have drawn on several arguments to defend the existence of unenumerated rights. Some argue that an unenumerated right is implied by certain amendments that assume the existence of such rights. Others argue that the Ninth Amendment, which states that individuals have protected rights beyond those listed in the first eight amendments, provides support for the existence of unenumerated rights. §§ Hyde Amendment of 1976 barred the use of certain federal funds to pay for abortions outside of incest, rape, or endangerment to the life of the pregnant woman §§ Board of Education of Independent School District No. 92 of Pottawatomie County v. Earls (2008) In a range of cases, the Supreme Court has used substantive due process to examine whether government laws and actions are arbitrary infringements of individual rights. While a right to privacy is not explicitly named in the Constitution, the Supreme Court, in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), interpreted the due process clause to protect the right of privacy from government infringement. In Roe v. Wade (1973), the Supreme Court held that the application of substantive due process further extended the privacy right to abortion. The Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022) overturned Roe v. Wade, holding that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, leaving decisions about the regulation of abortion to legislatures. The actions that are protected by the right to privacy and substantive due process continue to be debated. Civil rights protect individuals from discrimination based on characteristics such as race, national origin, religion, and sex; these rights are guaranteed to all persons under the due process and equal protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution, as well as acts of Congress. §§ Hatch Amendment (proposed 1981) The civil rights movement, the women’s rights movement, and advocacy for LGBTQ rights are evidence of how the equal protection clause can support and motivate social movements, as represented by: i. Dr. Martin Luther King’s “Letter from a Birmingham Jail” and the civil rights movement of the 1960s ii. The National Organization for Women and the women’s rights movement iii. The pro-life and pro-choice movements The government can respond to social movements through court rulings and/or policies. i. Supreme Court decisions which declared that race-based school segregation violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause. ii. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in public places, provides for the integration of schools and other public facilities, and makes employment discrimination illegal. iii. Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination in any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance. iv. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits racial discrimination in voting. Decisions demonstrating that minority rights have been restricted at times and protected at other times include: i. State laws and Supreme Court holdings based on the “separate but equal” doctrine restricting African American access to the same restaurants, hotels, schools, etc., as the majority white population ii. Court decisions declaring that race-based school segregation violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection clause iii. The Supreme Court upholding the rights of the majority in cases that limit and prohibit majority-minority districting Affirmative action refers to policies intended to address workplace and educational disparities related to race, ethnic origin, gender, disability, and age. Supreme Court debate has focused on whether affirmative action is protected by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. §§ Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007) §§ Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) §§ Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter v. Bollinger (2003)"

    title: "American Political Ideologies and Beliefs",
    period: "Unit 4",
    topic: "political socialization, core values, individualism, equality of opportunity, free enterprise, rule of law, political ideology, public opinion, scientific polling, Democratic Party, Republican Party, liberal ideology, conservative ideology, libertarian ideology, fiscal policy, monetary policy, Federal Reserve, social issues, government regulation, globalization",
    content: " Different interpretations of core values, including individualism (each person has the ability to shape their life and destiny through the choices they make), equality of opportunity (all people are given an equal chance to compete), free enterprise (the market determines prices, products, and services), and rule of law (every person, even those in power, must follow and is accountable to the same laws that govern all), affect the relationship between citizens and the federal government and that citizens have with each other. Political socialization refers to the process by which individuals develop political beliefs, values, opinions, and behaviors. Family, schools, peers, media, and social environments (including civic and religious organizations) contribute to the development of an individual’s political attitudes and values through the process of political socialization. U.S. political culture is defined by its democratic ideals, principles, and core values. As a result of globalization, U.S. political culture has both influenced and been influenced by the values of other countries. §§ Robert Putnam’s “Bowling Alone: America’s Declining Social Capital,” Journal of Democracy (1995) §§ Participating in Scouts or serving on a school board §§ Thomas Friedman’s The World Is Flat 3.0 (2007) or Joseph Stiglitz’s Making Globalization Work (2006) §§ Matt Barreto and Gary Segura’s Latino America: How America’s Most Dynamic Population Is Poised to Transform the Politics of the Nation (2014) Generational effects (experiences shared by people of a common age) and life cycle effects (experiences a person encounters during different life stages) contribute to the development of a person’s political ideology. Major political events can influence the development of individual political attitudes, which is an example of political socialization. Political socialization, in turn, influences political ideology. Public opinion data that can affect elections and policy debates is influenced by different types of scientific polls such as: i. Opinion polls (measuring public opinion on various issues) ii. Benchmark polls (creating baseline views of a candidate) iii. Tracking polls (following how views of a candidate change during a campaign) iv. Exit polls (collecting data on why people voted the way they did) Public opinion data that can affect elections and policy debates is influenced by polling methodology. Polling methodology is more precise when it includes: i. Accurate sampling methods, including calculating a margin of error ii. Neutral framing of questions (specific and unbiased wording of questions) iii. Accurate reporting (clear reporting and conclusions that can be supported by the data) The relationship between scientific polling and elections and policy debates is affected by the: i. Importance of public opinion as a source of political influence in a given election or policy debate ii. Reliability and veracity of public opinion data The Democratic Party (D or DEM) platforms generally align more closely to liberal ideological positions, and the Republican Party (R or GOP) platforms generally align more closely to conservative ideological positions. Because the U.S. is a democracy with a diverse society, public policies generated at any given time reflect the attitudes and beliefs of citizens who choose to participate in politics at that time. The balancing dynamic of individual liberty and government efforts to promote stability and order has been reflected in policy debates and their outcomes over time. §§ Seymour Martin Lipset’s “Ideology, Politics, and Deviance,” Chapter 1 of American Exceptionalism: A Double-Edged Sword (1996) §§ Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 §§ DREAM Act and debate over making English the official national language §§ Multiculturalism versus assimilation Required Course Content §§ Ideological positions on the inheritance tax §§ Ideological positions on the minimum wage Liberal ideologies favor more governmental regulation of the marketplace, conservative ideologies favor fewer regulations, and libertarian ideologies favor little or no regulation of the marketplace beyond the protection of property rights and voluntary trade. Fiscal policy consists of actions taken by Congress and the president to influence economic conditions and includes Keynesian and supply-side positions. Monetary policy consists of actions taken by the Federal Reserve (the Fed) to influence interest rates which affect broader economic conditions. The Fed is an independent agency which seeks to achieve maximum employment and price stability. Liberal ideologies generally favor more national government involvement to address some social issues such as education and public health, with less responsibility for these issues left to state governments. Conservative ideologies generally favor less national government involvement to address some social issues such as education and public health, with more responsibility for these issues left to state governments. § Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) §§ Ideological positions on school vouchers litigated in Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002) §§ Differing state requirements for marriage and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) ruling on same-sex marriage Libertarian ideologies generally favor little national or state government involvement except when national or state government is protecting private property or individual liberty. Policy trends concerning the level of government involvement in social issues reflect the success of conservative or liberal perspectives in political parties."

    title: "Political Participation",
    period: "UExpansion of opportunities for political participation are found in the legal protections of the Amendments to the Constitution. i. The 14th Amendment granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S., including formerly enslaved people. ii. The 15th Amendment granted African American men the right to vote. iii. The 17th Amendment changed the practice for electing Senators from a vote by state legislatures to a direct vote by the people. iv. The 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote. v. The 24th Amendment eliminated poll taxes, a structural barrier to voting. vi. The 26th Amendment lowered the voting age to 18. Various political models explain differences in voting behavior. i. Rational choice voting refers to individuals who base their decisions on what is perceived to be in their best interest. ii. Retrospective voting refers to individuals who decide whether the party or candidate in power should be reelected based on the recent past. iii. Prospective voting refers to individuals who vote based on predictions of how a party or candidate will perform in the future. iv. Straight ticket voting refers to individuals who vote for all of the candidates from one political party on a ballot. Structural barriers (such as polling hours, availability of absentee ballots, etc.), political efficacy (the belief that an individual’s participation in the political process will make a difference), and demographics can influence differences in voter turnout in the U.S. The following can influence voter turnout: i. Differences in state-controlled elections (the hours polls are open, Voter ID laws, variations in funding for polling places and workers, variations in types of voting allowed, such as voting by mail, absentee voting, and early voting) ii. Variations in voter registration laws and procedures (registering in-person, online, or automatically) iii. Election type (more turnout for presidential elections than midterm elections) Demographic characteristics and political efficacy or engagement are used to predict the likelihood of whether an individual will vote. Factors influencing voter choice include: i. Party identification and ideological orientation ii. Candidate characteristics iii. Contemporary political issues iv. Religious beliefs or affiliation, age, gender, race and ethnicity, and other demographic characteristics Linkage institutions are channels that allow individuals to communicate their preferences to policymakers: The functions and impact of political parties on the electorate and government are represented by: i. Mobilization and education of voters ii. Party platforms iii. Candidate recruitment iv. Campaign management, including fundraising and media strategy v. The committee and party leadership systems in legislatures Parties have adapted to candidate-centered campaigns where the public focus is on the characteristics of the candidate and not on the party. The role of parties in nominating candidates has also been weakened. Parties may adapt their policies and messaging to appeal to various demographic coalitions. The structure of parties has been influenced by: i. Critical elections (elections in which there is a realignment of political party support among voters) ii. Campaign finance law iii. Changes in communication and data management technology Parties use communication technology and voter data management to disseminate, control, and clarify political messages and enhance outreach and mobilization efforts. In comparison to proportional systems, winnertake-all voting districts serve as a structural barrier to third-party and independent candidate success. Winner-take-all voting advantages the two-party system in the U.S. The incorporation of third-party agendas into platforms of major political parties serves as a barrier to third-party and independent candidate success. Interest groups may represent very specific or more general interests, and can educate voters and office holders, conduct lobbying, draft legislation, and mobilize membership to apply pressure on and work with legislators and government agencies. Interest groups may also file an amicus curiae brief (a written document submitted as a “friend of the court” to provide additional information for justices to consider when reviewing a case). In addition to working within party coalitions, interest groups exert influence through iron triangles and issue networks that help interest groups exert influence across political party coalitions. The inequality of interest group resources affects the amount of influence they may have on the policymaking process. i. Some interest groups, such as AARP, have large memberships, are able to mobilize those members, and possess access to large financial reserves. ii. Some interest groups have more direct and more frequent access to important people in the policy process. continued on next page iii. Free riders are individuals who benefit from the work of an interest group without providing financial support. Interest groups may deal with this issue by providing selective benefits, goods and services that are only available to members, to encourage more people to join. Single-issue groups, ideological/social movements, and protest movements form with the goal of affecting society and policymaking. Competing actors such as interest groups, professional organizations, social movements, the military, and bureaucratic agencies influence policymaking, such as the federal budget process, at key stages and to varying degrees. Elections and political parties are related to major policy shifts or initiatives, occasionally leading to political realignments of voting constituencies.
